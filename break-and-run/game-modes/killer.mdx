description: Multi-player elimination game mode with lives system
---

Killer mode is a multi-player elimination game where players compete to be the last one standing. Each player starts with a set number of lives and loses a life when they fail to pot a ball on their turn.

## How it works

### Setup
1. Add 3 or more players to the game
2. Set the number of starting lives for each player (typically 3-5)
3. Optionally enable the trickshot black ball rule
4. Select who breaks first

### Gameplay
- Players take turns attempting to pot balls
- When a player fails to pot a ball, they lose one life
- Players are eliminated when they run out of lives
- The last player with lives remaining wins

### Trickshot black ball rule
When enabled, players can attempt to pot the black ball as a trickshot:
- **Success**: Player gains an extra life
- **Failure**: Player loses a life as normal

This adds a risk-reward element where skilled players can extend their game.

## Player management

### Adding players
You can add multiple players to a killer game:
- Minimum: 3 players
- Maximum: No limit (though 8-10 is practical)
- Each player gets a unique identifier and normalized name

### Player selection
During gameplay, the app uses animated player selection to indicate whose turn it is, making it easy to follow in multi-player scenarios.

### Lives tracking
Each player's remaining lives are displayed in real-time:
- Active players show their current life count
- Eliminated players are marked but remain visible
- Final standings show the order of elimination

## Game state

### Persistence
Killer games are fully saved and can be resumed:
- Player names and lives are stored
- Game options (trickshot rule) are preserved
- Frame history tracks all score changes
- Final standings are captured at game end

### Winner determination
The winner is determined by:
1. Last player with lives remaining
2. Winner name (not ID) is stored for consistency
3. Final standings show all players ranked by elimination order

## Data structure

Killer mode extends the standard game structure with:

```typescript
interface KillerPlayer {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // Display name
  normalizedName: string;  // Lowercase name for matching
  lives: number;           // Remaining lives
}

interface Game {
  // ... standard game fields
  gameMode: GameMode.KILLER;
  killerOptions?: {
    trickshotBlackEnabled: boolean;
  };
  killerPlayers?: KillerPlayer[];
}
```

## Recent improvements
