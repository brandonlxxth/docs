## Troubleshooting

### "adb: command not found"
Make sure you've installed ADB and are in the correct directory, or add ADB to your system PATH.

### "device unauthorized"
Check your phone for the USB debugging permission popup and tap "Allow".

### "INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE"
You may have an older version installed. Uninstall it first:
```bash
adb uninstall com.brandonlxxth.breakandrun
```
Then try installing again.

<Note>
If you previously installed "Pool Scoreboard", uninstall it before installing "Break & Run".
</Note>

### "INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE"
Free up storage space on your phone and try again.

### Device not showing in `adb devices`
- Verify USB debugging is enabled
- Try a different USB cable
- Change USB connection mode to "File Transfer" or "MTP"
- Restart ADB server:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

## Building from source

To build the APK yourself:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Go to **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK(s)**
4. Find the APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

Alternatively, use the build script:
```bash
