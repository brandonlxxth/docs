## Overview

The Kappture mobile app requires users to create a member account before placing orders. Members authenticate with email and password.

Member accounts are managed in the Management Portal under **Configuration > Member > Member**.

## Sign up

New users create an account with name, email, and password. After signing up, the member is logged in immediately and can start ordering.

The sign up form also requires accepting the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.

### Member creation in Management Portal

When a user signs up in the mobile app, a member record is created in **Configuration > Member > Member**. The member account includes:
- Member details (name, email, phone)
- Account balances (if account types are configured)
- Member group assignments
- Order history
- Loyalty points (if loyalty is enabled)

## Login

Returning users sign in with their email address and password. The app includes a "Forgot Password?" link to reset passwords.

## Forgot password

Members can reset their password if forgotten:

1. Enter email address on Forgot Password screen
2. Receive password reset email with a verification code
3. Enter the verification code
4. Enter new password with confirmation
5. Sign in with new password

The verification code is sent to the member's email address and must be entered to proceed with the password reset.

## Member groups

Members can be assigned to member groups in **Configuration > Member > Member Group**. Member groups control:
- Access to accounts (members must be in the account's member group to see and use the account in the app)
- Board item visibility (news/announcements)
- Special pricing or discounts
- Access to specific features or products
- Campaign targeting

Member group assignments are configured in **Configuration > Member > Member** in the Management Portal, not in the mobile app.

See [Member Group documentation](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group) and [Account documentation](/enterprise/pages/member/account) for configuration details.
