## Scan & Go

Scan & Go is a quick ordering mode that allows members to scan product barcodes to add items directly to their cart without browsing menus.

### How Scan & Go works

When ordering from a preparation point with Scan & Go enabled:

1. **Access scanner** - Tap the scan button (scanner icon) that appears as a floating action button in the order screen, or use the Scan tab
2. **Scan barcode** - Point the camera at a product barcode
3. **Instant add** - Product is automatically added to cart with haptic feedback
4. **Repeat** - Continue scanning multiple products
5. **Review cart** - View all scanned items in cart
6. **Checkout** - Proceed to checkout when finished

### When to use Scan & Go

Scan & Go is ideal for:
- Grab-and-go retail environments
- Convenience stores
- Quick service scenarios where customers pick products themselves
- Self-service markets

### Configuration in Management Portal

Scan & Go is enabled per preparation point in **Configuration > Sites > Preparation Points**:

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Sites**
2. Select the outlet
3. Click **Preparation Points** tab
4. Edit or create a preparation point
5. Enable **Is Scan And Go** checkbox
6. Save changes

When enabled, the mobile app displays a scanner button when ordering from that preparation point.

### Product requirements

For Scan & Go to work:
- Products must have barcodes configured in **Configuration > Management > Products**
- Barcode field must contain a valid barcode value
- Products must be available in the preparation point's menu
- Products must be active and in stock
