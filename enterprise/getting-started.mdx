## Navigating the Portal

### Using the Search

The search bar at the top of the page (or press `Ctrl+/` / `Cmd+/` on Mac) allows you to quickly navigate between different index pages in the Management Portal. 

Type the name of any page you want to access, and the search will show matching pages. Select a result to navigate directly to that page.

<Tip>
The search is particularly useful for quickly jumping to specific pages without navigating through the menu structure.

Use the search to find the record you need, then select it to view or edit. Within the results you can sort by column or move through pages when there are many results.
