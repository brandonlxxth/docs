## Ordering pages and features

### Online Events

Create and configure [online ordering events](/enterprise/pages/ordering/online-events). Set event names, date and time windows, pre-order options, event banners, and which preparation points fulfill orders. Online events are shown only on QR ordering (scan-to-order), not on kiosks.

### Dashboard

The [Ordering Dashboard](/enterprise/pages/ordering/dashboard) (Ordering > Dashboard) lets you **view** preparation point orders: summary totals by status (Received, In Progress, Ready, Collected/Delivered), per–preparation point breakdowns, and—with Order Status permission—the full order list for a preparation point by date. The dashboard is view-only; to **update** order status (e.g. mark courses done), use the **Kitchen Management Screen (KMS)** on a terminal. See [Terminal](/enterprise/pages/terminal/overview#kitchen-management-screen-kms).

### Product Stock

[Product Stock](/enterprise/pages/ordering/product-stock) (Ordering > Product Stock) lets you create **Product Stock templates** (products and quantity limits) and assign them to preparation points. Kiosks, QR ordering, and app ordering then use those limits so products can be hidden or blocked when sold reaches the limit. View current stock per preparation point from the [Ordering Dashboard](/enterprise/pages/ordering/dashboard) by clicking **Product Stock** on a preparation point card.

### Self Service Ordering

Configuration for self-service kiosk and mobile ordering:

- **[Kiosk Menu](/enterprise/pages/ordering/kiosk-menu)**: Configure kiosk menu layouts and product display
- **[Kiosk Menu Group](/enterprise/pages/ordering/kiosk-menu-group)**: Organize kiosk menus into groups for different locations or times
- **[QR Code Generator](/enterprise/pages/ordering/qr-code-generator)**: Generate QR codes for self-service ordering, allowing customers to scan and order from their mobile devices

### Future Order Close

[Future Order Close](/enterprise/pages/ordering/future-order-close) (Ordering > Future Order Close) closes all orders against the selected preparation points. You can optionally reset the future order sequence (e.g. collection numbers) for a new period or session.
