## Overview

The Dashboard (`/Dashboard`) provides a real-time overview of your business operations with live-updating metrics, interactive charts, and multiple breakdown views. Use it to monitor sales performance across sites, outlets, terminals, operators, and products.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Dashboard | Dashboard | Analytics |

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **Analytics > Dashboard** in the main navigation menu, or go directly to `/Dashboard`.

## Live data and dynamic refresh

The Dashboard displays **live data** that refreshes automatically. Key behaviours:

- **Auto-refresh**: Metrics and charts update in real time without requiring a page reload.
- **Live loading**: Data streams in as it becomes available, so you see transactions shortly after they occur.
- **Caching**: Dashboard caching has been optimised for performance; previously viewed data loads faster on subsequent visits.
- **Time zone**: Data is displayed in your configured time zone. You can update your time zone in your [User Profile](/enterprise/pages/user-profile#time-zone).

<Tip>
If you notice delays, check that your selected date range and filters aren't too broad. Narrower filters improve loading speed.
</Tip>

## Date and time selection

Use the date picker at the top of the Dashboard to select the time period you want to analyse:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Today** | Current trading day based on your Trading Day start time (default 00:00–23:59). |
| **Yesterday** | Previous trading day. |
| **This week** | Current week (Monday to Sunday). |
| **Last 7 days** | Rolling seven-day period. |
| **This month** | Current calendar month. |
| **Custom range** | Select specific start and end dates. |

<Info>
Your **Trading Day start time** is configured in your [User Profile](/enterprise/pages/user-profile#trading-day-start-time). This affects how "Today" and daily metrics are calculated. For example, if your trading day starts at 06:00, transactions at 02:00 count toward the previous day.
</Info>

## Filters

Narrow down the data displayed using the filter options:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Site** | Filter to one or more sites. Supports multi-selection. |
| **Outlet** | Filter to specific outlets within selected sites. |
| **Terminal** | Filter to specific terminals. |
| **Operator** | Filter to transactions by specific operators. |
| **Product Group** | Filter metrics to products in selected groups. |
| **Tags** | Filter by product tags for more granular analysis. |

<Tip>
Combine filters for targeted insights—for example, view sales for a specific operator at a specific outlet during lunch hours.
</Tip>

## Dashboard metrics

The Dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) at the top of the page:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Revenue** | Gross sales value for the selected period and filters. |
| **Transaction Count** | Number of completed transactions. |
| **Average Transaction Value** | Mean value per transaction. |
| **Covers** | Number of covers (customers served), if configured. |
| **Outlet Totals** | Aggregated totals broken down by outlet. |

Metrics update dynamically as new transactions come in and as you change filters or date ranges.

## Charts and visualisations

The Dashboard includes several chart types:

### Sales over time

A line or bar chart showing revenue and/or transaction count over the selected period. Hover over data points to see exact values for each time interval.

### Revenue breakdown

Pie or donut charts showing revenue distribution by:
- Site
- Outlet
- Product Group
- Tender type

### Trend comparison

Compare current period performance against previous periods (e.g. today vs. yesterday, this week vs. last week).

## Dashboard views

Switch between different breakdown views using the view selector. Each view shows the same core metrics but grouped by a different dimension.

### Site view

Breaks down metrics by **site**. Use this to compare performance across locations.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Site | Site name. |
| Revenue | Total revenue for the site. |
| Transactions | Number of transactions. |
| Avg. Transaction | Average transaction value. |

### Outlet view

Breaks down metrics by **outlet** within sites.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Outlet | Outlet name. |
| Site | Parent site. |
| Revenue | Total revenue for the outlet. |
| Transactions | Number of transactions. |
| Avg. Transaction | Average transaction value. |

### Terminal view

Breaks down metrics by **terminal**.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Terminal | Terminal name or ID. |
| Outlet | Parent outlet. |
| Revenue | Total revenue for the terminal. |
| Transactions | Number of transactions. |

### Operator view

Breaks down metrics by **operator** (staff member).

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Operator | Operator name. |
| Revenue | Total revenue for transactions served by this operator. |
| Transactions | Number of transactions. |
| Avg. Transaction | Average transaction value. |

Use this view to monitor individual staff performance and identify top performers.

### Product view

Breaks down metrics by **product**.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Product | Product name. |
| Quantity | Number of units sold. |
| Revenue | Total revenue from this product. |
| Avg. Price | Average selling price. |

### Product Group view

Breaks down metrics by **product group**.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Product Group | Group name. |
| Quantity | Total units sold in this group. |
| Revenue | Total revenue from products in this group. |

## Map view

The Dashboard includes a **map view** that displays site locations geographically. Each site marker shows:

- Site name
- Current revenue
- Transaction count

Click a marker to see more detail or to filter the dashboard to that site.

<Note>
The map view requires site location data to be configured. If locations are missing, markers won't appear.
</Note>

## Product frequency

The **Product Frequency** metric shows how often products are sold together or how frequently individual products appear in transactions. Use this to identify popular items and potential upsell opportunities.

<Warning>
When filtering by future dates, the Product Frequency metric returns no data (as expected). Ensure your date range includes past or current dates.
</Warning>

## Performance tips

| Tip | Why it helps |
|-----|--------------|
| **Use specific date ranges** | Narrower ranges load faster than broad ranges. |
| **Filter by site or outlet** | Reduces the dataset size for quicker rendering. |
| **Check your time zone** | Ensure your [User Profile](/enterprise/pages/user-profile#time-zone) time zone matches your operating region. |

<Tip>
To export data for offline analysis, use **Analytics > Reports**. Reports support CSV and Excel exports with customisable filters and date ranges.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Data not updating | Check your internet connection; try refreshing the page. If you are expecting new sales data, ensure connection is stable to any terminals |
| Incorrect time shown | Update your time zone in [User Profile](/enterprise/pages/user-profile#time-zone). |
| Map not displaying sites | Ensure site location data is configured. |
| Slow loading | Narrow your date range and filters; try a different browser. |
