## Overview

The **Heatmaps** section under **Analytics > Heatmap** allows you to create visual heatmap displays that overlay sales data on custom images such as floor plans, site maps, or venue layouts. Use heatmaps to visualise revenue and order patterns across your outlets throughout the day.

## How heatmaps work

A heatmap consists of:

1. **A background image** - Upload an image representing your venue, floor plan, or site layout
2. **Outlet markers** - Position markers on the image to represent each outlet's location
3. **Sales data overlay** - The system displays revenue or order counts as coloured heat indicators at each marker position

When viewing a heatmap, areas with higher sales activity appear as warmer colours (red/orange), while lower activity areas appear as cooler colours (blue/purple).

## Configuration

Navigate to **Analytics > Heatmap > Configuration** to create and manage heatmap configurations.
