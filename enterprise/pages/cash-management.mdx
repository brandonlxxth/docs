## Overview

The **Cash Management** section helps you manage cash and revenue across terminals and outlets. It is split into two areas in the menu:

1. **Cash Management** — Floats, reason codes, cash movements, session declarations and banking, cash vault, quick declare/bank/receive, and cash summary.
2. **Revenue Tracker** — Sales Tracker, Risk Summary, Outlet Hourly Sales, and Drawer Totals.

<Warning>
**Requires Revenue module**: Cash Management is only available when the Revenue module is enabled for your organisation. If you don't see Cash Management in the navigation, contact your administrator or [Kappture Sales](/contact) to enable the Revenue module.
</Warning>

## Required permissions

Cash Management permissions are configured in **Admin > User Roles** under the **Cash Management** tab. The tab is only visible when the Revenue module is enabled. Each page has its own permission; see the dedicated page for the exact permission name.

## Typical session and banking flow

1. **Allocate Floats** — Ensure outlets have starting float.
2. **Operators** close sessions on the terminal; Cash (and other declared tenders) require a declaration in the portal.
3. **Sessions Declaration** — Enter **Declared at Cash Office** and **Variance Reason** for each session with status **Declaration Required**.
4. **Sessions Banking** — Select declared sessions, enter reference and bag number, and mark as **Banked**.
5. **Cash Summary** and **Drawer Totals** — Use for reconciliation and oversight.

For quick workflows, use **Quick Declare**, **Quick Bank**, and **Quick Receive** with QR/barcode scanning where configured.
