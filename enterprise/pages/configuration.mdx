## Overview

## Management

Management is where you configure day-to-day operations: what products are sold, how they are priced, how the till screen looks (layouts), who can operate it (operators and operator roles), how customers pay (tenders), and how receipts and menus behave. It also includes **checklists** (shown when operators open a session), **messaging** (send messages to terminals), and **Pay at Table** and **Receipt Portal** (QR code generation). These settings are used by terminals and self-service kiosks. Layouts and product prices link to **sessions** (operational periods) and **outlets**: each outlet has sessions, and for each session you assign a price band and layouts, so the same outlet can use different layouts and prices at different times.

For a full explanation of how Management pieces link together (sessions, price bands, layouts, product prices, terminals, operators, tenders, and the rest), see the Management overview.

## Terminal

Terminal management and monitoring: hierarchy (create and edit terminals by outlet), status, session activity, session management, jobs, and security. Each terminal has a **type** (operator POS, kiosk, kitchen screen, etc.) and is configured with receipt, checklist, pay-at-table options, and payment options (credentials for your payment provider). Layout and session behaviour come from the **outlet** (Outlet Sessions).
