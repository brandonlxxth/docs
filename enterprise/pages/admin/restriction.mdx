## Overview

Restrictions are labels you create here by **name** only. You assign them to [User Roles](/enterprise/pages/admin/user-roles) (User Role Restriction tab) or override them per [User](/enterprise/pages/admin/users) (User Restriction tab). They work by **hiding entities** that have the matching restriction: when a user has a restriction, they cannot see any entity (e.g. product, outlet, site) that has that same restriction assigned. For example, a product tagged "Confidential" is only visible to users who do *not* have the "Confidential" restriction.

Navigate to **Configuration > Admin > Restriction** in the navigation menu.

## Using Restriction

### Viewing restrictions

Use the search box at the top to find restrictions; results appear below, showing name and whether each restriction is in use.

### Creating a restriction

1. Click the **+** icon to create a new restriction.
2. Enter a **name** (e.g. "Confidential", "Regional only"). Use a name that makes it clear what the restriction is for.
3. Click **Save**.

## Assigning to Roles and Users

- **To a role**: [User Roles](/enterprise/pages/admin/user-roles) → edit the role → **User Role Restriction** tab → select the restrictions.
- **To a user**: [Users](/enterprise/pages/admin/users) → edit the user → **User Restriction** tab → check **Override user restriction** → select the restrictions.

Entities with those restrictions will be hidden from users who have them (via role or user override).

## Restriction fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Label for the restriction (e.g. Confidential, Regional only). When a user has this restriction, they cannot see any entity (product, outlet, site) that has the same restriction assigned. |

### Editing and deleting

- **Edit**: Search for the restriction and select it from the results below, click **Edit**, change the **name**, then Save. Changes affect all roles, users, and entities using it.
- **Delete**: Use **Usage** / **Get Usage** to see where the restriction is used. Remove it from all roles, users, and entities first. Search for the restriction, select it from the results, then click **Delete**.

<Warning>
Do not delete a restriction that is still assigned to any role, user, or entity. Remove it from all of those first.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names so it's obvious what each restriction is for.
- Review usage periodically; avoid creating duplicate restrictions for the same rule.
