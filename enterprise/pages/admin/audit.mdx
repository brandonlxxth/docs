## Overview

The Audit page lets you view and export system audit logs. Audit logs record user activity and system events for security, compliance, and troubleshooting.

## Accessing the Audit Page

Navigate to **Configuration > Admin > Audit** in the navigation menu.

## Viewing Audit Logs

When you open the Audit page, you'll see a **search box at the top**. Enter criteria such as event type, user, or date range, then run the search; results load in a modal below. Each entry includes:

- **Date and time** of the event
- **User** who performed the action
- **Event type** or action
- **Notes** or details about the action
- **Related entity** (e.g., which record was changed)

## Exporting Audit Logs

To export audit data:

1. Use the search box to narrow results (date range, user)
2. Click the "Export" button
3. Choose the format (e.g. CSV) when prompted
4. The file will download with the audit entries matching your search

Use exports for:

- Compliance reporting
- Security reviews
- Archiving
- External analysis

## Best Practices

- **Review regularly**: Periodically review audit logs for unusual activity
- **Retain exports**: Export and store audit data according to your retention policy
- **Use search**: Use the search box with date range and user to focus on specific periods or users
- **Investigate anomalies**: Follow up on unexpected or repeated events
