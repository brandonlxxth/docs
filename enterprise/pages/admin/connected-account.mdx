## Editing or Disconnecting

- If the page allows editing, open the connected account and change details as needed, then Save

## Best Practices

- **Document purpose**: Note which connected accounts are used for (e.g. "Live payments", "Accounting export")
- **Secure access**: Only allow trusted staff to add or change connected accounts
- **Review regularly**: Periodically review connected accounts and remove unused or obsolete connections
- **Follow provider docs**: Use the external service’s documentation for setup and security (e.g. API keys, OAuth)
