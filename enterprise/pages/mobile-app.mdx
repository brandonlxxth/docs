## Overview

The **Mobile App** section in the Management Portal (under **Configuration > Mobile App**) configures content that appears in the Kappture mobile app for members. Currently this includes the Board feature for news and announcements.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Board | Board | Configuration (Mobile App) |

## Board

The Board displays news, announcements, and updates to mobile app users. Each board item appears as a card with an image, title, and rich text content.

### Creating a board item

Navigate to **Configuration > Mobile App > Board** and click **Create**.

### Details tab

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Title of the board item (e.g. "New Summer Menu", "Holiday Hours"). Max 50 characters. Required. Displayed as the card title in the mobile app. |
| **Reference** | Optional internal reference (e.g. campaign ID, ticket number). Max 50 characters. Not displayed to end users. |
| **Restriction** | Apply a restriction to control when this board item is visible. Select from **Configuration > Admin > Restriction**. Optional. |
| **Image** | Banner image for the board item. **PNG format only**. Max file size 1MB. Required. Displayed at the top of the card in the mobile app. Upload via drag-and-drop or click to select. |
| **Body** | Rich text content of the announcement. Required. Supports formatted text, lists, links. Max 500 characters. Use the text editor to format content. HTML tags are allowed. |

### Member Groups tab

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Member Groups** | Select which member groups can see this board item. If no groups are selected, the board item is visible to all members. Select one or more groups from **Configuration > Member > Member Groups**. Use the search box to filter groups. |

### Usage

- Board items appear in the mobile app's news/board section
- Items are ordered by creation date (newest first)
- Members only see board items assigned to their member groups (or all items if no groups are selected)
- Restrictions control visibility based on time, date, or other conditions
- Board items can be edited or deleted (if not in use)

### Best practices

1. **Use clear, engaging titles** - The name appears as the card title
2. **Choose high-quality images** - PNG format, optimized for mobile screens
3. **Keep body content concise** - Max 500 characters keeps content scannable
4. **Target relevant audiences** - Use member groups to show relevant content to specific segments
5. **Use restrictions for time-sensitive content** - Schedule announcements to appear/disappear automatically
