## Overview

The Stock Scan app is an Android-only application designed for the Zebra TC27 scanner terminal. It is intended for retail environments such as supermarkets where most products are barcoded and identified using shelf-edge labels.

## Features

The Stock Scan app integrates with the Management Portal and supports:

- Operator login using PoS ID and PIN
- Managing multiple stock-enabled outlets (based on operator permissions)
- Barcode scanning for all product-related functions
- Creating stock adjustments using reason codes
- Creating stock orders (saved per supplier for later authorisation)
- Creating stock takes, including automatic stock take period generation
- Creating shelf-edge label requests
- Recording product wastage
- Checking product information via barcode scan

## Required Setup

### Outlet and Terminal

- The outlet must have **Stock Holding** enabled
- A single terminal record must be created for the handheld device
- After creating the terminal, go to **Outlet Configuration > Stock Control > Stock Terminal** and assign the handheld terminal

### System User

A database user with the **System User** flag must exist. This should be present by default; do not remove it.

### Generate Client Device Keys

Each device requires a unique QR code to authenticate the app with a specific environment and OrgId.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable permission">
  Ensure the user role permission **Client Device** is enabled.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Client Devices">
  Go to **Admin > Client Devices**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create device record">
  Create a new device record with a name and optional reference.
</Step>

<Step title="Scan QR code">
  A unique QR code is generated. Scan this code on the device. Each code can be used once per device.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the QR prompt is closed, regenerate a code by editing the device and selecting **Generate API Key**.
</Note>

### Confirming Credentials on Device

On first launch, the app prompts for a QR code scan. After scanning, the device displays the OrgId and environment for confirmation.

In the Management Portal, the device shows as **Identified**. Devices not yet linked display as **Not Identified**.

### Clearing App Credentials

To reset the device (e.g., to switch OrgId):

1. Hold the orange **Login** button for five seconds
2. The admin screen appears showing OrgId, Environment, App Version, and Device ID
3. Select **Clear Credentials**, then confirm
4. The device returns to the QR setup screen

### Client Device Count Sheets

Count sheets available to handheld devices can be restricted using tick boxes in the Client Device record. By default, **all** sheets are available.

### Operator Setup

Operators require:

- A login code and PIN
- Outlet assignments (controls visibility in the app)
- Appropriate security type (PIN rules)

If an outlet is missing from the app, check the operator's outlet permissions.

### Product Configuration

Products must have:

- Name and group
- Barcode
- Product type: **Stock** or **Terminal & Stock**
- Stock availability for the selected outlet
- Stock control UoM and count sheet group
- Primary supplier configuration (UoM, pricing)
- Depletion rule configuration (required for wastage)

### Required Codes and Groups

- **Stock Reason Codes**: At least one required
- **Waste Reason Codes**: At least one required
- **Stock Count Sheets / Groups**: Sheets must be assigned to product groups
- **Stock Suppliers**: Required for stock orders

## Operation

After operator login, available outlets are shown. If only one outlet is assigned, the app goes directly to that outlet's home screen.

The outlet home screen displays six functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Adjustment** | Create stock adjustments with reason codes. |
| **Order** | Create stock orders (saved for later authorisation). |
| **Stock Take** | Complete stock takes with barcode scanning. |
| **Labels** | Create shelf-edge label requests. |
| **Waste** | Record product wastage. |
| **Product Info** | View product details by scanning barcode. |

## Making Stock Adjustments

<Steps>
<Step title="Select reason code">
  Select a reason code (applies to all items in the adjustment).
</Step>

<Step title="Scan products">
  Scan products and enter quantities (positive or negative). **Zero Stock** sets quantity to reach zero.
</Step>

<Step title="Review and confirm">
  On the Confirm page, swipe left on an item to edit or delete. Confirm to complete the adjustment.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Adjustments are submitted immediately and cannot be saved for later authorisation.
</Note>

## Making Stock Orders

<Step title="Scan products">
  Scan products to add them to the order.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm quantities">
  For each product, confirm the quantity.
</Step>

<Step title="Review and submit">
  The confirmation page groups items per supplier. Submitting creates **saved** (not authorised) orders.
</Step>
</Steps>

Orders must be authorised later in the Management Portal using **Order Status**.
</Warning>

## Completing Stock Takes

- Select a count sheet before scanning
- Scanned products populate with expected quantity; adjust as needed
- Negative quantities cannot be set
- A yellow banner shows remaining uncounted items
- When all items are counted, the banner turns green
- Each submitted stock take creates a new period named: **Stock Take YYYY-MM-DD**

## Creating Shelf Edge Labels

1. Scan products to create a label request
2. For each product, set quantity
3. Submit to send the request to **Management > Product Label**
4. In the portal, select **Print Labels**, choose a price band, and generate the print document

<Note>
Labels can only be created for products with existing barcodes. This tool cannot assign new barcodes.
</Note>

## Recording Product Wastage

1. Select a wastage reason code
2. Scan products and enter wastage quantities
3. Submit to create the wastage record

<Warning>
Wastage uses cost prices, not selling prices. Wastage will not post if the product does not have a depletion rule.
</Warning>

## Product Info

Scanning a product displays:

- Units of measure
- Prices
- Supplier details
- Current stock quantity
- Last ordered information
- Selling prices per price band

Useful for verifying shelf-edge label accuracy.

## Data Storage
