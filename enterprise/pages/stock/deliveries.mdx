## Overview

Stock Deliveries allow you to record the receipt of goods from suppliers against previously authorised orders. When you receive a delivery, you enter the quantities received for each product, and the system automatically updates your stock levels. The Delivery Report provides a comprehensive view of all deliveries.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why can't I select an order to create a delivery?**

Only orders with status "Authorised" or "Partially Delivered" can have deliveries created. If an order is "Unauthorised", it must be authorised first. If an order is "Complete" or "Cancelled", no deliveries can be created.

**What happens if I enter a delivery quantity greater than what was ordered?**

The system shows a warning message, but you can still save the delivery. This allows you to record over-deliveries while identifying potential errors.

**Can I edit a delivery after saving it?**

No. Once saved and authorised, deliveries cannot be edited. If you need to correct a delivery, create an adjustment to correct the stock levels.
