## Overview

The Stock Validator is a read-only configuration review tool that helps you quickly check whether your stock setup is complete and usable. It highlights products and outlets that are missing key settings (such as count sheets, suppliers, or stock holding flags) so you can correct them in the relevant configuration pages.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why is my outlet not appearing in the dropdown?**

Only outlets you are assigned to will appear. Additionally, the list is filtered to stock-holding outlets. If an outlet is not configured as stock-holding, it will not appear.

**Why do I see "N/A" for Stock Holding Outlet or Stock Request Outlet?**

These relationships have not been configured for the selected outlet. Update the outlet configuration to set appropriate values.

**Why are some products missing from the table?**

By default, only products with issues are shown. Tick **Show All** to see all products.

**Can I fix settings directly in Stock Validator?**

No. Stock Validator is view-only. Make changes in the relevant configuration pages (Product, Supplier, Count Sheet, Outlet settings), then refresh Stock Validation to confirm.
