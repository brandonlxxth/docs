## Overview

Stock Alerts is a real-time monitoring system that displays pending stock movement events requiring action. The page shows three types of alerts: Stock Verification (opening stock counts), Stock Close (closing stock counts), and Stock Requisition (stock transfer requests). These alerts automatically feed into the user notification system, ensuring relevant users are notified when action is required.

All stock alert types are created by Point of Sale terminals.

## Using Stock Alerts

### Viewing Alerts

1. Navigate to **Stock > Stock Movements > Stock Alerts**
2. The page automatically refreshes every 5 seconds
3. Use the filter checkboxes to show/hide specific alert types:
   - **Verification**: Toggle Stock Verification alerts
   - **Stock Close**: Toggle Stock Close alerts
   - **Requisition**: Toggle Stock Requisition alerts

### Claiming an Alert

Claiming is useful for large stock teams working through many alerts:

1. Find the alert in the table
2. Click the **Claim** button
3. The button changes to **Release** and shows your username
4. Other users will see that the alert is claimed by you

<Note>
Only one user can claim an alert at a time. Claiming indicates you are working on it but doesn't prevent others from viewing it.
</Note>

### Processing an Alert

1. Click anywhere on the alert row (except the button)
2. You will be taken to the appropriate page:
   - **Stock Verification** alerts → Stock Open page
   - **Stock Close** alerts → Stock Close page
   - **Stock Requisition** alerts → Stock Requisition page
3. Complete the required actions on that page
4. Once processed, the alert disappears from the Stock Alerts page

## Notification System

### How Alerts Feed into Notifications

Stock alerts automatically generate user notifications when events are created. Notifications ensure users are informed even when not actively viewing the Stock Alerts page.

### Receiving Notifications

**Inbox Notifications:**
- Appear in your system inbox (notification bell icon)
- Click to go directly to the relevant stock event page
- Remain until you process the event or mark as read

**Email Notifications:**
- Sent when stock events are created
- Contain details about the event and a link to process it

## Additional Reports

- **PoS Stock Movements**: Historical report of each outlet's stock movements (requisition, verify, close) with operator, date/time, and status

## Frequently asked questions

**Why don't I see any alerts on the Stock Alerts page?**

Possible reasons:
- You don't have the "Stock Alerts" permission
