## Overview

The Requisition pages let you raise stock requisitions from the back office instead of using the point of sale. You can either:

- **Requisition**: Request stock from a stock request outlet into a single outlet
- **Outlet to Outlet Requisition**: Move stock directly between two stock-holding outlets

These tools work with your existing stock take periods and count sheets, so requisitions fit naturally into your stock control process.

<Note>
If you wish to move stock from outlet to outlet without the full 3-stage process, use regular **Stock Transfer** instead.
</Note>

## Frequently asked questions

**Why can't I see any outlets on the Requisition page?**

The tree and dropdowns only include stock outlets you are assigned to. If you see a "No stock outlets" message, an administrator needs to update your outlet assignments.

**Why is the Create Requisition button not appearing?**

You must select an item at the **outlet level** in the hierarchy tree, not a higher-level node (such as site or area).

**Why can't I create an outlet to outlet requisition with the same outlet for source and destination?**

Outlet to outlet requisitions are designed to move stock between two different outlets. Selecting the same outlet for both sides is not allowed.

**Why doesn't the requisition save?**

Requisitions must be linked to a valid stock take period for the outlet. If there is no current stock take period, the requisition cannot be created.

**Why are some products not included when I save?**

Only products with a quantity of 1 or more on the requisition sheet are included. Products left at zero are treated as not requested.
