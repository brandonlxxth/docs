## Overview

Stock Returns allow you to record products being returned to suppliers. When you create a return, you specify the outlet, supplier, and products being returned. Once saved, the return is automatically authorised and applied to stock levels. The Return Report provides a comprehensive view of all returns.

<Note>
A return will only reduce current stock levels, not increase them.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why don't I see any products when creating a return?**

Products only appear if they are assigned to the selected supplier and available at the selected outlet. Verify that products are properly configured for both.

**What happens to stock levels when I save a return?**

When you save a return, it is automatically authorised and applied to stock. The quantities returned are deducted from the outlet's stock levels immediately.

**Can I return products to multiple suppliers in one return?**

No. Each return can only be for one supplier. Create separate returns for each supplier.
