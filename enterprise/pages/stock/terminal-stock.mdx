## Overview

When stock control is enabled, PoS terminals reduce stock through **SALE** and **WASTE** transactions. K-Stock enables outlets to perform daily stock operations directly on the PoS including stock verification, requisitions, transfers, and stock queries.

<Note>
**REFUND** and **CANCEL** orders do not modify stock levels.
</Note>

Any Kappture device that can place **SALE** orders will deplete stock, including standard PoS, Kiosks, Quickserve, Self Checkouts, and Ordering Servers (QR ordering, App, API).

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Stock Alerts | Stock Alerts | Stock Control (Stock Movements) |

<Note>
Each K-Stock function is controlled by **Operator Role** permissions. Operators in **Training Mode** cannot access stock functions, and stock depletion does not occur for training sales.
</Note>

## Stock Depletion Configuration

### Stock-Holding Outlet

Enable **Stock Holding** in: **Configuration > Terminal > Hierarchy > Outlet > Stock Control**

<Warning>
Once an outlet is set as Stock Holding, it cannot be reverted. If done in error, the outlet must be recreated.
</Warning>

### Stock Request Outlet

A stock-holding outlet must define where stock is depleted from:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Self** | The outlet uses its own stock (e.g., a bar). |
| **Another Outlet** | Stock is drawn from a different outlet (e.g., a mobile unit drawing from a nearby bar). |
| **Mixed Sources** | Use Product Depletion Groups to define different source outlets per product. |

### Product Setup

A product will only deplete stock when **all** of the following are configured:

- **UoM**: Stock Control Unit of Measure
- **Stock Supplier Price**: Required for stock valuation
- **Depletion Rule**: Defines which stock item is reduced on sale

## K-Stock Configuration

### Terminal Configuration

- **Terminal Operation Type** must be set to **Bar with stock**
- Stock status is managed **per outlet**, not per terminal
- It is recommended to have **one designated stock terminal per outlet**
- Multiple terminals can be enabled but may cause operational conflicts

### Stock Take Period

- A **Stock Take Period** must be assigned to the outlet
- K-Stock always uses the **most recent active** stock take period

### Product Configuration for K-Stock

A product must meet **all** of the following to appear in PoS stock functions:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Product Price** | An outlet price is required, even if not sold at PoS. 0.00 is acceptable. |
| **Product Type** | Must be **Terminal & Stock**. |
| **Availability** | The product must be available in the outlet. |
| **Count Sheet** | Products appear grouped by Count Sheet Group. |

## K-Stock Functions

When enabled, operators see a **Stock** panel on the PoS home screen:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Verify** | Perform opening stock count. |
| **Requisition** | Request stock from the request outlet. |
| **Transfer** | Move stock to another outlet. |
| **Accept** | Sign for and finalize approved requisitions. |
| **Query** | View real-time stock levels. |
| **Close** | Perform closing stock count. |

## Stock Status States

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No period available** | No stock take period exists. Verification cannot begin. |
| **Period Closed** | A stock period is assigned and ready to start verification. |
| **Verify Pending** | Opening count submitted and awaiting approval. |
| **Verify Rejected** | Opening count rejected. Review and resubmit. |
| **Period (Name) Open** | Verification approved. Requisition, transfer, and close are available. |
| **Close Pending** | Closing count submitted and awaiting approval. |
| **Close Rejected** | Closing count rejected. Review and resubmit. |

### Rejections

- Rejected counts include details explaining what must be rechecked
- Rejected products appear **red** in the Verify/Close screens
- Rejection messages appear in **Alerts** and on the **Stock** panel

## Requisition

When selecting **Requisition** or **Transfer**, operators can choose:

- **Standard Products**: Products included in the current count sheet
- **All Products**: All stock products in the database

The **All Products** view includes a **Search** function.

## Accepting Requisitions

Once a requisition is approved:

1. The Accept screen displays a list of transfer numbers
2. Select a transfer to view approved products and quantities
3. Select **OK** to open the signature screen
4. Sign and confirm acceptance
5. The transfer is finalized and stock is updated

## Transfer Process

When performing a transfer:

1. The system displays a list of stock-holding outlets
2. The operator selects an outlet and adds products
3. On confirmation, the transfer is completed automatically

<Note>
Transfers are completed immediately and do not require back-office approval. If this functionality is not required, it can be disabled via operator permissions.
</Note>

## Stock Only Terminal Mode

For devices dedicated solely to stock tasks:

1. Create a standard terminal in **Configuration > Terminal > Hierarchy**
2. Edit the terminal
3. Change the **Type** to **Stock Only**
4. Save the record

Operators can perform stock functions but cannot make sales.

## Device Support

| Device Type | Stock Panel Support |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Windows, K1, K2 (landscape) | Full support |
| Mobile devices (portrait) | No Stock panel, but still deplete stock through sales/waste |

## Out of Stock Enforcement

<Note>
If a product's current stock quantity is zero or below, terminals are **not restricted** from selling the item. This ensures system issues or operator errors do not interrupt trading.
</Note>

For self-service terminals, a separate **preparation point stock system** is available to set product limits and prevent orders once limits are reached. This system is independent of the Kappture Stock system.
