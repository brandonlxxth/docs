- Once this date passes, the period can no longer be assigned to outlets
- If a stock take is still in progress after the date passes, it must still be completed

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I assign the same period to multiple outlets?**

Yes. Use the Bulk Period Assignment feature to assign one period to many outlets at once.

**Why can't I uncheck some periods when editing an outlet?**

Periods that are in progress or complete cannot be unassigned. Only periods with "Pending" status and future dates can be modified.

**What happens if I assign a period with a past date?**

Periods with past dates cannot be assigned to outlets. The system only allows assignment of periods with future dates and "Pending" status.

**Can I delete a period that's been assigned to outlets?**

No. Once assigned, a period cannot be deleted. Check usage by clicking the Usage button.

**What's the difference between single and bulk assignment?**

Single assignment allows you to assign multiple different periods to one outlet. Bulk assignment allows you to assign one period to multiple outlets at once.
