## Overview

Stock Orders allow you to create purchase orders from suppliers for your outlets. Orders can be created manually, from templates, or prefilled using par level settings. Once created, orders must be authorised before they can be delivered. The Order Status page provides a centralized view to manage multiple orders, authorise them, cancel them, and track their delivery status.

<Info>
Ordering is a two-stage process: **Order & Delivery**. Ordering stock does not update the current stock on hand until it has been delivered. You cannot make a delivery without an order.

  In the modal, select:
  - **Supplier**: The supplier you're ordering from

### Adding products to an order

5. The **Unit Price** is automatically populated from supplier pricing (can be modified)
6. The **Line Total** is calculated automatically (Quantity × Unit Price)

<Note>
If you modify a unit price, the system asks if you want to permanently update the supplier's price for this product. If you confirm, the new price is saved in the product supplier configuration. If you decline, the price change only applies to this order.

Entering the same notes every time? In each outlet, you can configure **Order Default Notes** in **Configuration > Terminal > Hierarchy > Outlet > Stock Control**. This automatically pre-populates the notes box when creating an order.
