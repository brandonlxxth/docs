## Overview

The Product Depletion Rules (Stock Depletion) tab controls how stock is reduced when a product is sold. Depletion rules define the relationship between selling a product at the point of sale and the reduction of stock levels for one or more stock products.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |

## Accessing Depletion Rules

Navigate to **Management > Products > [Product] > Depletion Rules tab**.

## Understanding Depletion Rules

### One Rule or Multiple?

This depends on the use case:

| Scenario | Depletion Rules |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Simple product** | Most products only deplete a single stock product (e.g., a Cola Bottle depletes itself). |
| **Composite product** | A product containing multiple ingredients (e.g., a cocktail or burger) needs multiple rules, each depleting a different stock product. |

### Depletion Line Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product** | The product that will cause depletion (can be the same as the main product, or a related item). |
| **Unit of Measure** | The selling UoM for that product (e.g., "Each", "Bottle", "Case of 24"). |
| **Quantity** | The depletion quantity - how much stock of the count unit is reduced when one unit is sold. |

### Help Button

Clicking the **Information (i)** button opens the **Depletion Quantity** helper. This helper reads the product's base unit of measure configuration and shows different screens depending on how that unit is set up.

## Depletion by Base Unit Type

### Simple Base UoM (e.g., "Each")

For products where the base unit of measure is a simple unit (such as "Each"):

- The help panel shows a written explanation of the calculation
- Depletion quantity = Selling quantity ÷ Count unit of measure quantity

**Example: Apples**
- Apples are purchased in boxes of 10
- Each apple sold should reduce stock by one apple from a box
- Selling quantity: 1
- Count unit of measure: Box of 10
- Depletion quantity: 1 ÷ 10 = **0.10**

### Volume-Based UoM (Kegs, Pints, Shots)

For products where the base unit of measure is volumetric (gallons or litres):

- A table shows pre-calculated options
- Select a **Selling Unit of Measure** to see the **Depletion Quantity**
- Click **Select** to copy the chosen depletion quantity back to the field

**Common Gallon Types:**
- Pint, Half Pint
- 11 Gallon Barrel
- Barrel, Puncheon, Tun
- Gallon

**Common Litre Types:**
- Bottle (1 litre)
- Double Spirit (50ml), Single Spirit (25ml)
- Magnum (1.5 litre)
- Glass (175ml), Glass (125ml)
- 500ml (0.5 litre)

## Depletion Examples

| Base Unit | Business Case | Stock Control Unit | Depletion Rule |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Each** | Cola bottles counted and sold individually | Each | Cola Bottle depletes itself with quantity **1** |
| **Gallon** | Lager counted by gallon, sold as pints | Gallon | Lager Pint depletes Lager Keg with quantity **0.125000** |
| **Gallon** | Ale counted using 11-gallon kegs | 11 Gallon Keg | Ale Pint depletes Ale 11 Gallon Keg with quantity **0.011364** |
| **Litre** | Whisky 70cl bottles, sold in 25ml shots | 70cl bottle | Whisky Single depletes Whisky Bottle 70cl with quantity **0.035714** |
| **Litre** | Red wine 75cl bottles, sold by glass | 75cl bottle | Red Wine 125ml Glass depletes Red Wine Bottle with quantity **0.166667** |
| **Litre** | Daiquiri uses rum, lime juice, syrup | Multiple bottles | Three rules: Rum (0.071429), Lime Juice (0.030000), Syrup (0.015000) |

## Configuring Depletion Rules

</Step>

<Step title="Go to Depletion Rules tab">
  Click on the **Depletion Rules** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Depletion Group (optional)">
  Choose a **Product Depletion Group** if you need outlet-specific depletion routing.
</Step>

<Step title="Add depletion lines">
  Click **Add** to create depletion lines. For each line:
  - Select the component **Product** and **Unit of Measure**
  - Enter the **Quantity** to deplete
  - Use the **Help (i)** button for calculation assistance
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Save the product to apply the depletion rules.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For volume-based products (kegs, bottles), use the Help button to access pre-calculated depletion quantities based on common serving sizes.
