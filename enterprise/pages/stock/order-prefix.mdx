## Overview

Order Prefixes allow you to create and manage prefixes that are prepended to stock order numbers. They help identify and organize stock orders by adding a text prefix to the order number, making it easier to distinguish orders from different outlets, departments, or locations.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Order Prefix | Order Prefix | Stock Control (Stock Administration) |

## Accessing Order Prefix

Navigate to **Stock > Stock Administration > Order Prefix**.

## Understanding Order Prefixes

An order prefix is a text string (such as "ORD-", "BAR-", "KIT-") that is prepended to stock order numbers. When a stock order is created, the system automatically formats the order number as:

**Prefix + Order ID padded to 8 digits**

| Prefix | Order ID | Formatted Order Number |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| ORD- | 123 | ORD-00000123 |
| BAR- | 4567 | BAR-00004567 |
| VENUE-A- | 567 | VENUE-A-00000567 |

### Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prefix Assignment** | Order prefixes are assigned to outlets (not directly to orders). Each outlet can have one prefix assigned. |
| **Order Number Format** | The prefix is followed by the order ID, padded with zeros to 8 digits. |
| **Outlet Configuration** | Prefixes are assigned in the **Stock Control** tab of outlet configuration. An outlet can have no prefix (orders will have no prefix). |

## Creating an Order Prefix

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Order Prefix">
  Go to **Stock > Stock Administration > Order Prefix**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create new prefix">
  Click the **Create** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter name">
  Enter a **Name** for the prefix (e.g., "ORD-", "BAR-", "KIT-", "VENUE-A-").
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click **Save** to create the prefix.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Naming tips:**
- Use descriptive prefixes that help identify the source or type of orders
- Common formats include abbreviations followed by a hyphen (e.g., "ORD-", "BAR-")
- Use location codes, department codes, or outlet identifiers
- Keep prefixes short but meaningful
</Tip>

## Editing an Order Prefix

1. Navigate to **Stock > Stock Administration > Order Prefix**
2. Select the prefix from the dropdown list
3. Click **Edit**
4. Modify the **Name** field
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
Changing a prefix name affects all future orders created for outlets using that prefix. Historical orders retain their original order numbers with the previous prefix.
</Note>

## Deleting an Order Prefix

Order prefixes can only be deleted if they are not currently assigned to any outlets.

1. Select the prefix you want to delete
2. Click **Edit**
3. If not in use, a **Delete** button will be available
4. Click **Delete** and confirm

<Warning>
Before deleting a prefix, ensure it is not assigned to any outlets. Remove the prefix assignment from each outlet first (set it to "None").
</Warning>

## Assigning Prefixes to Outlets

Order prefixes are assigned to outlets during outlet configuration:

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Terminal > Hierarchy > Outlet**
2. Open or create an outlet
3. Click on the **Stock Control** tab
4. In the **Order Prefix** dropdown, select the prefix
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
The Order Prefix field is optional. If no prefix is selected, stock orders for that outlet will not have a prefix in their order numbers.
</Note>

## Where prefixes appear

Order prefixes appear in:

- Stock order header when viewing or editing orders
- Stock order lists and reports
- Delivery records and receipts
- Order status tracking
- Search results and filters

## Order prefix fields reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | The prefix text that will be prepended to order numbers. |

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use the same prefix for multiple outlets?**

Yes. Multiple outlets can share the same prefix when they're in the same category (e.g., all bars use "BAR-"). Each order will still have a unique order number because the order ID is unique.

**How long can a prefix name be?**

There is no specific documented limit, but keep prefixes short and meaningful. Very long prefixes may make order numbers difficult to read.

**What characters can I use in a prefix name?**

Letters, numbers, and common punctuation characters (such as hyphens). Use a consistent format across all prefixes for better organization.

**How do I know which prefix an outlet is using?**

Navigate to **Hierarchy > Outlet**, open the outlet, and check the **Stock Control** tab. The **Order Prefix** dropdown shows the currently assigned prefix.
