## Overview

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I transfer to multiple destinations in one transfer?**

Yes. You can select multiple destination outlets. However, you will only see the source stock quantity, not individual destination stock quantities. Each destination receives the same products and quantities.

**What happens if the source outlet doesn't have enough stock?**

The system warns you with a yellow highlight on products with insufficient stock. You can still proceed, but the source outlet's stock levels will become negative.

**Can I edit a transfer after it's been authorised?**

No. Once authorised, a transfer cannot be edited. Use the reverse function and create a new transfer if needed.

**Can I save a transfer and come back to it later?**

No. You must add all required products and authorise it in the same session.
