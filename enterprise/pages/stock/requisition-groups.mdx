## Overview

Product Requisition Groups allow you to configure custom sourcing rules for stock requisitions. This feature lets you override the default stock request outlet on a per-product basis, giving you fine-grained control over which outlet supplies stock for specific products.

This is particularly useful when:

- **Wet vs. dry storage separation**: Route beverages from climate-controlled wet storage and packaged goods from dry storage
- **Premium wine cellar management**: Direct fine wines and champagnes from a dedicated cellar to VIP areas
- **Multi-level stadium operations**: Source concession stock from the nearest storage facility on each level
- **Fresh vs. packaged separation**: Direct fresh ingredients from kitchen prep areas and packaged goods from dry storage

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Product Requisition Groups | Product Requisition Group | Stock Control (Stock Administration) |
| Product Assignment | Product | Configuration (Management) |

## How It Works

By default, each outlet has a **Stock Request Outlet** setting that determines where all stock requisitions are sent. Product Requisition Groups override this default behavior for specific products.

When a stock requisition is accepted via Stock Alerts:

1. The system checks if the product belongs to a Product Requisition Group
2. If **yes**: It uses the custom outlet mapping from the group
3. If **no**: It uses the outlet's default Stock Request Outlet

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Product Requisition Groups:

1. **User Roles**: Your user needs the "Product Requisition Groups" role
2. **Stock-Holding Outlets**: Source outlets must be configured as stock-holding outlets
3. **Products**: Products must already be created in your system

## Creating a Product Requisition Group

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Requisition Groups">
  Go to **Stock > Stock Administration > Product Requisition Groups**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create new group">
  Click the **Create** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter name">
  Enter a descriptive name indicating the products or sourcing strategy (e.g., "Fresh Produce Group", "Beverage Distribution").
</Step>

<Step title="Configure outlet mappings">
  For each outlet, specify which outlet should fulfill stock requests:
  - **Outlet**: The outlet that will be requesting stock
  - **Request Outlet**: Select which outlet should fulfill requests
    - Choose **Default** to use the outlet's standard Stock Request Outlet
    - Choose a specific outlet to override the default for products in this group
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click **Save** to create the group.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You don't need to configure a custom request outlet for every outlet. Outlets set to "Default" will continue using their standard Stock Request Outlet configuration.
</Note>

## Assigning Products to Requisition Groups

### During Product Creation or Editing

1. Navigate to **Management > Products** and open a product
2. Go to the **Requisition Rules** tab
3. In the **Product Requisition Group** dropdown, select the group
4. Save the product

### During Bulk Import

When importing product updates:

1. In your product import file, include the Product ID and name
2. Use the export function to get a template with existing products
3. The import process assigns all products in the file to the selected group

<Warning>
Removing a product from a requisition group reverts it to using the outlet's default Stock Request Outlet setting.
</Warning>

## Example Scenarios

### Wet vs. Dry Storage

**Situation**: Your stadium has separate storage facilities for beverages and packaged goods.

**Setup**:
1. Create "Wet Storage Group" - Map all concession outlets → Wet Storage Facility
2. Create "Dry Storage Group" - Map all concession outlets → Dry Storage Facility
3. Assign beverages to Wet Storage Group
4. Assign dry goods to Dry Storage Group

**Result**: Stock requisitions automatically route to the correct storage facility.

### Wine Cellar Distribution

**Situation**: You have a main alcohol storage and a separate climate-controlled wine cellar.

**Setup**:
1. Set all outlets' default Stock Request Outlet to Main Beverage Storage
2. Create "Premium Wine Cellar Group"
   - Map premium dining outlets → Wine Cellar
   - Map VIP lounges → Wine Cellar
   - Map standard concessions → Default
3. Assign premium wines and champagnes to Wine Cellar Group

**Result**: Premium wines route from the wine cellar while standard beverages use main storage.

## Understanding the Workflow

When a stock requisition is processed:

1. **Stock Alert Generated**: Terminal creates requisitions via K-stock
2. **Information Button**: Products with requisition groups show "This product will be requested from [Outlet]"
3. **Requisition Accepted**: Management portal user accepts the requisition
4. **System Checks Product**: Determines source outlet based on requisition group or default
5. **Transfer Created**: Stock transfer is created from source outlet(s) to requesting outlet
6. **Operator Accepts**: Operator accepts approved transfers using K-stock
7. **Stock Updated**: Stock tables are updated

<Note>
Products with requisition groups can result in multiple transfers if different products have different source outlets.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Products not routing to expected outlet | Verify product is assigned to the requisition group. Check outlet mapping isn't set to "Default". |
| Requisition group not in product dropdown | Confirm the group was saved. Verify you have correct permissions. |
| All products using default outlet | Check products are assigned to the group. Verify outlet mapping configuration. |
