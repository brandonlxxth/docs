## Overview

Stock Verification is designed for quick spot counts to verify inventory levels without performing a full stock take. Unlike formal stock takes that cover all products in a count sheet, stock verification allows you to quickly check specific products or sections of your inventory. When verification counts differ from expected quantities, the system automatically creates stock adjustments to reconcile the differences.

## How Adjustments Are Created

When you save verification counts, the system automatically:

1. Calculates the difference between counted and expected quantities for each product
2. Creates a stock adjustment record for products with variances
3. Sets the adjustment quantity to the variance (positive for increases, negative for decreases)
4. Uses the product's preferred cost price to calculate adjustment values
5. Records the adjustment with a reference format: `VERIFY|Outlet Name|YYYY-MM-DD`
6. Includes a note indicating the adjustment was created from stock verification

<Note>
The adjustment is immediately applied to your stock records, updating inventory levels to match your verification counts.

## Stock Verification vs Stock Take

| Feature | Stock Verification | Stock Take |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Quick spot checks of specific products | Formal process covering all products in a count sheet |

| **Timing** | Anytime | Scheduled periods |

## Frequently asked questions

**Why can I only select one outlet when entering verification?**

Stock Verification is designed for quick spot counts at a single location. You can print verification sheets for multiple outlets, but counts must be entered one outlet at a time.

**What happens if I enter a count that matches the expected quantity?**

No adjustment is created for that product. Only products with variances generate adjustments.

**Can I edit verification counts after saving?**

No. Once saved and adjustments are created, you cannot edit the verification directly. Perform another verification or create manual adjustments if needed.

**Why are some rows highlighted in yellow?**

Rows are highlighted when the count differs from the expected quantity. The highlighting updates in real-time as you enter counts.
