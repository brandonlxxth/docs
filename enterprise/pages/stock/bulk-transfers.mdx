The bulk transfer features provide automated ways to manage stock transfers between outlets:

- **Bulk Transfer**: Transfer all products from a source outlet to a destination outlet based on current stock counts
- **Replenish Stock**: Automatically create transfers to bring selected outlets up to their par levels
- **Withdraw Stock**: Automatically create transfers to remove excess stock from selected outlets down to their par levels

## Frequently asked questions

**Why don't I see any outlets when trying to use these features?**

Your user role may not have outlets assigned, or the outlets may not be configured as stock-holding outlets. Contact your system administrator.

**What happens if an outlet doesn't have a requisition outlet configured?**

For Replenish Stock and Withdraw Stock, outlets must have a requisition outlet configured. Without one, an error status appears and no transfer is created.

**Can I edit the quantities before saving in Replenish or Withdraw Stock?**

No, these features automatically calculate quantities based on par levels. For custom quantities, create a regular transfer manually. However, in Bulk Transfer, you can modify quantities before saving.

**Can I cancel transfers created by these features?**

Once created and saved, transfers are automatically authorised and cannot be cancelled. Use the Reverse Transfer feature to create new transfers with reversed quantities.
