## Overview

The Stock Dashboard provides a visual overview of stock status across all outlets in your organization. It displays outlet cards showing the current stock state, requisition activity, and par level alerts, allowing you to quickly identify which outlets need attention.

Each outlet card shows key metrics including the number of requisitions, fulfilled requisitions, completed movements, and rejected movements. The dashboard also highlights products that are below minimum par levels or above maximum par levels.

<Note>
Current stock state refers to the Point of Sale outlet stock state. Stock-only outlets like cellars and stores will not appear on the stock dashboard by default.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why don't I see all outlets on the dashboard?**

The Stock Dashboard only displays outlets you have access to through your user role. Also check if filters are applied that may be hiding outlets.

**Why does an outlet show "No Period Available"?**

No stock take period has been configured for that outlet. A system administrator needs to configure and assign a stock take period.

**Can I take action directly from the dashboard cards?**

The dashboard is primarily for monitoring. Click on par level badges to view detailed reports. Navigate to **Stock > Stock Alerts** to process pending verifications.

**How often does the dashboard update?**

The dashboard shows real-time data when you load or refresh the page. It doesn't automatically refresh - reload the page to see updated information.
