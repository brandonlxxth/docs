## Overview

The Supplier page allows you to create and manage supplier master data in the system. Suppliers are the companies or vendors from whom you purchase products. This page enables you to maintain supplier information including contact details, addresses, and supplier codes, which are then used throughout the system for product configuration, stock ordering, and reporting.

## Understanding Suppliers

A supplier in the system represents a vendor or company from which you purchase products. Each supplier record contains:

- **Basic Information**: Name and supplier code
- **Address Details**: Full address including multiple address lines, locality, region, post code, and country
- **Contacts**: One or more contact persons with their details (name, email, phone, title, department)

### Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Supplier Code** | An optional code used to identify the supplier. Useful for reporting and integration with external systems. Displayed alongside the supplier name in dropdown lists. |
| **Primary Contact** | Each supplier can have multiple contacts. One contact can be designated as the primary contact. Only one contact can be primary at a time. |
| **Supplier Usage** | Once created, suppliers can be assigned to products (through the Product Supplier tab). Suppliers are used in stock ordering, delivery tracking, and reporting. |

<Warning>
Suppliers cannot be deleted once created to maintain data integrity. If you need to stop using a supplier, edit the name to indicate it's no longer active (e.g., add "DISCONTINUED" prefix).
