## Overview

Stock Adjustments allow you to record changes to your inventory levels that occur outside of normal stock movements (such as deliveries, transfers, or returns). This feature is essential for correcting stock discrepancies, recording waste, theft, or damage, and adjusting inventory to match physical counts.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why can't I see the Authorise button?**

The Authorise button only appears when:
- You have the "Authorise Adjustment" permission
- The adjustment has been saved (has an adjustment number)
- The adjustment has at least one line item with a non-zero quantity
- The adjustment has not already been authorised

**Can I edit an adjustment after it's been authorised?**

No. Once authorised, adjustments cannot be edited or deleted. This ensures data integrity and maintains an accurate audit trail. Create a new adjustment to reverse or correct errors.

**What happens if I enter a negative quantity?**

Negative quantities reduce stock levels. This is useful for recording waste, theft, damage, or other stock reductions.

**Can I print an adjustment before it's authorised?**

No. The print function is only available for authorised adjustments.
