## Accessing Stock Take

Navigate to **Stock > Stock Take > Stock Take**.

The page displays a hierarchy tree on the left and a period table on the right. Select an outlet to view its associated stock take periods.

## Performing a Stock Take

### Starting a Stock Take

1. Select an outlet from the hierarchy tree
2. Review the stock take periods displayed in the table
3. Click **Edit** on a period (available for current periods or periods with status "Pending")
4. Confirm that you want to start the stock take when prompted

### Entering Stock Counts

The Enter Stock Count step displays a table of products organized by count sheet groups.

**Manual Entry:**
- Enter counts directly in the Count column for each product
- Counts are saved automatically when you leave a field
- Counts can include decimal values (up to 2 decimal places)
- Counts are limited to a range between -1,000,000.00 and 1,000,000.00

**Available Actions:**
- **Import**: Upload a CSV file containing stock counts
- **Export**: Download current counts as a CSV file
- **Print**: Print a count sheet for physical counting (requires permission)

### Importing Stock Counts

You can import stock counts from a CSV file to save time.

**CSV Format:**

```
Product Id,Product,Unit of Measure Id,Unit of Measure,Count Sheet Group Id,Count Sheet Group,Count
123,Product A,1,Each,5,Group 1,25.50
124,Product B,1,Each,5,Group 1,10.00
```

<Note>
The header row is included but automatically skipped during import. Only Product Id, Unit of Measure Id, and Count columns are required.
</Note>

**Common Import Errors:**
- Invalid Product Id format
- Invalid Unit of Measure Id format
- Invalid Count value (must be a number)
- Product not found on the count sheet

### Viewing Reports

After entering counts, navigate to the Reports step to access:

| Report | Description |
|--------|-------------|

### Resetting a Stock Take Period

<Warning>
Resetting a stock take period cannot be undone. Make sure all counts are correct and reports have been reviewed before resetting.

The Reset step finalizes the stock take period. This action:
- Completes the stock take process
- Updates stock current quantity based on entered counts
- Resets ALL movement columns in the stock on hand report to 0
- Sets the opening and current counts
- The period status becomes "Completed" for the outlet

</Tip>

## Frequently asked questions

**Why can't I edit a stock take period?**

Stock take periods can only be edited if they are the current period or have "Pending" or "In Progress" status. Completed periods cannot be modified.

**What happens if I enter a count incorrectly?**

You can update counts at any time before resetting the period. Change the value and it saves automatically.

**Can I import partial counts?**

Yes. The import function only updates products included in your file. Products not included retain their existing counts.

**Can I undo a reset?**

No. Once a period has been reset, it cannot be edited or undone.
