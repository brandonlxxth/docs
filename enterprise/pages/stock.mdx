## Overview

The Stock section provides comprehensive inventory management tools for tracking, managing, and reporting on your inventory across all locations. From ordering and receiving stock to performing stock takes and managing depletion rules, the Stock module covers the full inventory lifecycle.

<Warning>
**Requires Stock Module**: The entire Stock section requires the Stock module, which is charged separately. If you don't see this section in your navigation, contact your administrator or [Kappture Sales](/contact) to enable the Stock module.
