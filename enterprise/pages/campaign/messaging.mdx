## Overview

The Messaging page (Campaign) lets you send one-off messages to members’ smartphones and/or email. You can target a **single member** or **everyone in a member group**. Messages can be sent as push notification, email, or both. This is useful for announcements, reminders, or ad-hoc communication.

## Using Messaging

### Accessing Messaging

Navigate to **Configuration > Campaign > Messaging** in the navigation menu.

### Sending a Message

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Messaging page">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Campaign > Messaging**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose who receives the message">
  Use the toggle to choose:
  - **Member** — send to one member (use the search/select to find and choose the member).
  - **Member Group** — send to everyone in a member group (select the group from the dropdown).
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the message content">
  You must provide at least one of:
  - **Subject** — used for email (optional if you only send push).
  - **Push notification** — short text sent to members’ devices (e.g. app).
  - **Email body (HTML)** — rich email content using the editor (headers, bold, lists, etc.).
</Step>

<Step title="Send">
  Click the save/submit button. Your messages are sent to the chosen member(s). A confirmation message confirms that the messages have been sent.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
You must enter content in at least one of **Push notification** or **Email body**. If you only want push, leave the email body empty; if you only want email, leave push empty. You can also send both.
</Info>

### Message Types

- **Push notification** — Short text that appears on the member’s device (e.g. in the Kappture app). Keep it brief for best results.
- **Email** — Full HTML email with subject. Use the rich editor to format the email body (headings, bold, lists, links, etc.).

### After Sending

- The system records that the campaign was sent (for audit).
- Members in the chosen member group (or the single member) receive the message according to their notification preferences and how your organisation has configured delivery (e.g. via app, email provider).

<Warning>
Sending to a large member group can generate many push and/or email messages. Confirm the member group and content before sending.
</Warning>
