## Overview

Notification templates define reusable content for automated notifications—email and push—that the system sends to members in specific situations: **receipt emails** (for orders), **voucher entitlement and redeem messages**, **welcome or registration messages when a member joins**, and **verification emails** (e.g. when verifying an email address).

You create and edit templates here; then you assign a template in the place that uses it (Site, Voucher, etc.). Each template has a **name**, **notification source** (used as subject/from in email), **subject**, **email body** (HTML), and optionally **push notification text**. You can also choose **Use email only** so the template sends email only and does not require push text.

You need the **Notification templates** permission (maintain notification templates) in your user role to access this page.

## Using notification templates

### Accessing notification templates

Navigate to **Configuration > Campaign > Notification templates** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing notification templates

When you open the Notification templates page, you’ll see a **search/selector at the top** and a **+** icon to create a new template. Choose a template from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a notification template

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Notification templates page">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Campaign > Notification templates**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new template">
  Click the **+** icon to create a new notification template.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter template details">
  Fill in the form:
  - **Name** — A name for the template (e.g. "Email receipt", "Voucher entitlement"). Used when selecting the template in Site, Voucher, or other configuration.
  - **Notification source** — Identifies the source of the notification (used as subject/from in email).
  - **Subject** — Email subject line (optional depending on usage).
  - **Email body (HTML)** — The email content. Required. Use the rich editor for formatting (headings, bold, lists, links). Supports placeholders where the system supports them (e.g. for order or member details).
  - **Use email only** — If checked, the template is email-only and push text is not used or required. If unchecked, you must enter **Push notification text**.
  - **Push notification text** — Short text for push notifications. Required unless **Use email only** is checked. Keep it brief (150 characters or less) for best results on devices.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click Save. The template is saved and can be selected in Site (email receipt), Voucher (entitlement/redeem), member registration, or other places that use notification templates.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Email body** is always required. **Push notification text** is required unless **Use email only** is checked. This ensures every template is valid for the channels you intend to use.
</Info>

### Editing a notification template

1. Open **Configuration > Campaign > Notification templates**.
2. Select the template from the list at the top. The form loads below with the template’s current values.
3. Change **Name**, **Notification source**, **Subject**, **Email body**, **Use email only**, or **Push notification text** as needed.
4. Click Save.

<Warning>
Changing a template affects every place that uses it (all sites using it for email receipt, all vouchers using it for entitlement, etc.). Confirm impact before saving changes.
</Warning>

## Where notification templates are used

These systems use notification templates:

- **Receipt emails** — Email receipts for orders. When you configure a site, you choose which template to use for receipt emails sent to members.
- **Vouchers** — Entitlement and redeem messages. When you set up a voucher (or reward), you choose templates for the message sent when a member is entitled to it and when they redeem it.
- **Member registration** — Welcome or registration messages. When a new member is registered, the system sends a notification using the template configured for the site.
- **Verification emails** — When the system sends verification messages (e.g. to verify a member’s email address), it uses the template assigned for verification.

When you configure a site, voucher, or other feature that sends these messages, you choose which notification template to use from the list you create here.
