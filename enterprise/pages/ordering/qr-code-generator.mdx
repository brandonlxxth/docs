## Overview

The QR Code Generator creates QR codes that customers scan to open the ordering experience on their phone. You must select a **Preparation Point** and a **Price Band**; you can then set an optional table number, default language, cost centre, and order type (collection only, manual table entry, or seat order). The page shows the ordering URL and an OpenID login URL, and you can download the QR code image or copy the URLs to use on signage, table tents, or digital displays.
