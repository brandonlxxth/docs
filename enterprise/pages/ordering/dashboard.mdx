## Overview

The Ordering Dashboard (Preparation Point Dashboard) gives you a single view of preparation point orders across your outlets. You can see how many orders are in each stage—Received, In Progress, Ready, and Collected/Delivered—both in total and per preparation point. From the dashboard you can open the Order Status view for a preparation point to see individual orders, or open Product Stock for preparation points that use it.

The dashboard is **view-only**. To change order status (e.g. mark courses as done or collected), staff use the **Kitchen Management Screen (KMS)** on a terminal.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Ordering Dashboard | Dashboard | Online Ordering (Catalog Ordering) |
| Order Status (per prep point) | Order Status | Online Ordering (Catalog Ordering) |
| Product Stock (per prep point) | Preparation Point Stock | Online Ordering (Catalog Ordering) |

You need **Dashboard** to see the dashboard. **Order Status** controls whether you can open the orders list for a preparation point. **Preparation Point Stock** controls whether you can open Product Stock from a preparation point card (and only appears when that preparation point has product stock configured).

## Accessing the Ordering Dashboard

Navigate to **Ordering > Dashboard**.

## What the dashboard shows

### Summary cards (top of page)

Four cards show totals across all preparation points you have access to:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|----------------|
| **Received** | Number and value of orders received, plus percentage of total. |
| **In Progress** | Number and value of orders in progress, plus percentage of total. |
| **Ready** | Number and value of orders ready for collection/delivery, plus percentage of total. |
| **Collected / Delivered** | Number and value of orders collected or delivered, plus percentage of total. |

Each card has a progress bar for the percentage. Count is number of orders; value is the order total.

### Preparation point cards

Below the summary, each preparation point has its own card showing:

- **Preparation point name**
- The same four statuses (Received, In Progress, Ready, Collected/Delivered) with count and value for that preparation point only
- **Orders** button (utensils icon): opens the Order Status view for that preparation point (if you have Order Status permission)
- **Product Stock** button (boxes icon): opens the Product Stock view for that preparation point (if you have Preparation Point Stock permission and the preparation point has product stock configured)

Only preparation points for outlets you have access to appear.

## Order Status view (per preparation point)

When you click **Orders** on a preparation point card, you see the Order Status page for that preparation point.

### Filters

- **Date**: Choose the date to view. Default is today.
- **Status checkboxes**: Show or hide orders by status—Received, In Progress, Ready, Collected/Delivered. All are selected by default.

Click **Go** after changing the date to load orders for that date.

### Order list

The table lists orders for the selected date and preparation point. Each row shows:

- **Date**
- **Member**
- **Course**
- **Order Status**
- **Order Number**
- **Total**

Click a row to expand it and see the order lines (product, quantity, net, tax, gross). Click again to collapse.

### Auto-refresh

The Order Status view refreshes automatically every 5 minutes so the list stays up to date. A countdown shows when the next refresh will happen.

## Updating order status

<Warning>
You cannot change order status from the Management Portal. The dashboard and Order Status view are for monitoring only. To mark orders as in progress, ready, or collected/delivered, use the **Kitchen Management Screen (KMS)** on a terminal at the preparation point.
</Warning>
