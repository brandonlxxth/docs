## Overview

**Future Order Close** closes all orders against the selected preparation points. Use it when you want to close orders at those preparation points—for example at the end of a service period (e.g. half-time, interval, or day). You can also optionally **reset the future order sequence**, which resets the collection numbers used for future orders so the next orders start from a fresh sequence.
