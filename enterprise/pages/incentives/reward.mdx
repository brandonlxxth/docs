## Overview

The Reward page lets you create rewards that give members a **voucher** when they meet a goal you set. You choose one of three reward types—Number of Visits, Value of Orders, or Number of Products—set the goal (e.g. 5 visits, £50 spend, 10 products), and pick which voucher is awarded when the goal is met. Rewards are assigned to **individual members** or **member groups** via the [Voucher](/enterprise/pages/incentives/voucher) page: create a Reward voucher and assign it like any other voucher.

## Reward types

When you create a reward, you first choose a type on the **Select Reward Type** screen. Each type defines what the member must do to unlock the Award voucher.

- **Number of Visits**: The member must make a set number of orders (visits). When they reach that count, they receive the Award voucher. Use this for repeat-business rewards (e.g. every 5 visits).

- **Value of Orders**: The member must reach a total spend amount (in the reward’s currency). When they reach that value, they receive the Award voucher. In the **What** step you choose which products or product groups count toward the spend.

- **Number of Products**: The member must purchase a set quantity of products from the products or product groups you include. When they reach that quantity, they receive the Award voucher. In the **What** step you set the include/exclude product and product group rules.

For all types you select the **Award** voucher (the voucher the member gets when the goal is met). That voucher must already exist—create it on the [Voucher](/enterprise/pages/incentives/voucher) page first (e.g. Allowance, Discount).

## Viewing rewards

When you open the Reward page, you’ll see a selector at the top and a **+** icon to create a new reward. Choose a reward from the list to view or edit it; the form loads in the content area below.

## Creating a reward

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Reward page">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Incentives > Reward** in the navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Start a new reward">
  Click the **+** icon to create a new reward.
</Step>

<Step title="Select reward type">
  On the **Select Reward Type** screen, click the card for the type you want: **Number of Visits**, **Value of Orders**, or **Number of Products**. You are then taken to the form for that type.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete the reward form">
  Fill in the form. Each type uses a stepper:
  - **Step 1 (Reward)**: Name, Description, Currency, notification templates (entitlement and redeem), optional Game link, **Award** voucher (the voucher the member receives when the goal is met). Optional: Member redeem limit.
  - **Step 2**: When the reward applies—date range, time of day, days of the week, and sessions
  - **Step 3**: Where it applies—which terminals (outlets)
  - **Step 4**: The goal for the type (number of visits, total value of orders, or number of products). For Value of Orders and Number of Products you also choose which products or product groups count (include or exclude). Optional: hide reward from member.
  - **Step 5**: Optional terms and conditions

  Click **Save** when you have finished.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Editing a reward

1. Open the Reward page and select the reward from the list
2. Update the details in the form
3. Click **Save** to apply changes

## Best practices

- **Create the Award voucher first**: The voucher you give when the goal is met must exist before you set it as the Award
- **Use clear names**: So staff and members can tell rewards apart
- **Check validity**: Set or review date ranges so expired rewards don’t appear
