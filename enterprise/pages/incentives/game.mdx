## Overview

The Game page lets you create games (Stamp type) with a **Name** and **Caption**. Games are not configured with prizes or rules here—they are **linked from rewards**. On a [Reward](/enterprise/pages/incentives/reward) you can optionally select a game so the member interacts with it (e.g. a stamp card) while working toward the reward goal. The reward defines the goal and the Award voucher; the game is the experience and caption the member sees.

## Using Games

### Viewing games

When you open the Game page, you’ll see a selector at the top and a **+** icon to create a new game. Choose a game from the list to view or edit it; the form loads in the content area below.

### Creating a game

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Game page">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Incentives > Game** in the navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Start a new game">
  Click the **+** icon to create a new game.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter game details">
  Fill in **Name** and **Caption**. The caption is the text the member sees for the reward game. Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Editing a game

1. Select the game from the list on the Game page
2. Update **Name** or **Caption**
3. Click **Save** to apply changes

You can only delete a game if it is not linked to any reward. Use the usage action to see which rewards use the game.

## Game fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the game (e.g. Stamp card, Collect stamps). |
| **Caption** | Text the member sees for the game (e.g. "Collect stamps for a free coffee"). |

## Using games with rewards

Games are used by **rewards**. On the Reward form, step 1 has an optional **Game** field—select a game so that reward uses that game experience (e.g. stamp card). The reward’s goal and **Award** voucher are set on the reward; the game only provides the interaction type and caption.

## Best practices

- **Clear caption**: Use a caption that tells the member what the game is (e.g. “Collect stamps”)
- **Create before linking**: Create the game here, then select it when creating or editing a reward
