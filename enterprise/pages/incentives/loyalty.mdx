## Overview

The Loyalty page lets you configure loyalty point strategies. Members earn points on qualifying orders; when their points reach the threshold you set, their account is credited. Loyalty programs can be assigned to **individual members** or to **member groups**—for example on registration or on purchases—so members in that group earn points and can redeem them.

<Info>
You can set a default loyalty and **Registration Loyalty** (with **Registration Points** for points on registration) per **member group**. See [Member](/enterprise/pages/member/member) and [Member Group](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group) for assigning to members and groups.

## Using Loyalty

### Viewing loyalty programs

When you open the Loyalty page, you'll see a **search box at the top**. Type your search (e.g., loyalty program name) and results will appear below. Each result shows the program name and key settings.

<Step title="Open the Loyalty page">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Incentives > Loyalty** in the navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Create new loyalty program">
  Click the **+** icon to create a new loyalty program.

<Step title="Enter program details">
  Fill in the loyalty program in the stepper. Each step covers:
  - **Step 1 (Loyalty)**: Name, Description, Currency, Award Account, Earn Conversion Rate (e.g. 1 point per £0.50 spent), Award Threshold, Award Conversion Rate (e.g. £0.01 per point). Presets appear in the dropdowns.
  - **Step 2**: When the program applies—date range, time of day, days of the week, and sessions
  - **Step 3**: Where it applies—which terminals (outlets)
  - **Step 4**: Which products or product groups count toward earning points (include or exclude)
  - **Step 5**: Optional Terms & Conditions
</Step>

<Step title="Save the program">

### Editing a loyalty program

To edit an existing loyalty program:

1. Use the search box to find the program, then select it from the results
2. Click on the program or use the "Edit" action
3. Update the settings as needed
4. Click "Save" to apply changes

### Assigning loyalty to members or member groups

Loyalty programs can be assigned to individual members or to member groups.

#### Assigning to an individual member

1. Open the [Member](/enterprise/pages/member/member) page
2. Use the search box to find the member, then open their details
3. In the member form, find the **Loyalty** section and select the loyalty program(s) to assign to that member
4. Save the member

That member will then be enrolled in the selected loyalty program(s).

#### Assigning to a member group

To assign a loyalty program to a member group (e.g., so members earn points when they register):

1. Open the [Member Group](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group) page
2. Create a new group or edit an existing one
3. In the group form, open the **Configuration** tab for **Registration Loyalty** and **Registration Points** (points on registration), or the **Loyalty** tab to assign which loyalty programs apply to the group
4. Select the registration loyalty program and set **Registration Points** (number of points on registration) if needed
5. Save the group

Members who register in that group will then receive the configured loyalty and registration points.
