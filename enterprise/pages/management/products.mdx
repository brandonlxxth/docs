## Overview

Products are the **core of the Kappture product**: everything you sell at the till, on kiosks, or in ordering is a product. You create and maintain products here. Each product has a **name**, **reference** (code/SKU), **product group**, and optional details such as image, barcodes, description, allergens, tags, waste reason, and product challenge (restrictions). You then set **product prices** per outlet and per price band, and use products in **layouts** (menus, product shortcuts), **menus** (including popup menus assigned to a product), **Product Label**, and reporting.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Products | Product | Configuration (Management) |

The product form is organised into **tabs**: **Details**, **Options**, **Cost Price**, **Prices**, **Allergens**, and—when the Stock module is enabled—**Stock Control**, **Availability**, **Par Level**, **Supplier**, **Stock Depletion**, and **Requisition Rules**. There is also a **Signage** tab. Each tab holds a specific set of fields or lists.

You need the **Product** permission to access this page.

## Using Products

### Accessing Products

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Products** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing products

When you open the Products page, you see a **search/selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Search or choose a product; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a product

1. On the Products page, click the **+** icon.
2. **Details** tab: Enter **Name** (required) and **Product Group**. Add any other details you need (see [Product fields reference](#product-fields-reference) below for what each field does).
3. Use the **Options**, **Cost Price**, **Prices**, **Allergens**, and **Signage** tabs as needed. If the Stock module is enabled, use **Stock Control**, **Availability**, **Par Level**, **Supplier**, **Stock Depletion**, and **Requisition Rules**.
4. Click Save.

Prices can also be set from **Configuration > Management > Product Prices** instead of the product **Prices** tab.

### Editing a product

1. Open the Products page and select the product from the list (or search).
2. Change any tab: **Details**, **Options**, **Cost Price**, **Prices**, **Allergens**, Stock tabs, or **Signage**.
3. Click Save.

You can **Copy** a product to create a new one based on it. You can **Import** and **Export** products when your role has the relevant permissions. Use the **Usage** button to see where the product is used (layouts, menus, etc.). Products that are in use (e.g. on layouts or in self-service) cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas; for self-service, the delete option is restricted and an information message is shown.

## How products link

- **Product Prices**: Prices are set per **Outlet** and per **Price Band** on **Configuration > Management > Product Prices**, or on the product’s **Prices** tab. Sessions use a price band, so when the till is in a session, it uses that session’s price band’s prices for products.
- **Product Groups**: Products belong to **Product Groups** (Configuration > Management > Product Groups). Groups are used in Product Prices (to filter the outlet price grid when editing prices—import does not use product group), in Layouts (product shortcuts, menus), and in reporting.
- **Layouts**: Products and product groups appear in **Layouts** as menus and product shortcut tiles. Assigning a **Popup Menu** to a product on the Details tab means that when an operator taps that product on the till, that menu opens (e.g. milk options for a coffee product).
- **Menus**: Menu content is built from products or product groups. Menus can be added as tiles on a layout or assigned to a product as a popup menu.
- **Product Label**, **Allergens**, **Product Tags**, **Waste Reason**, **Product Challenge**: Configured under Management and attached to products; used on terminals, in ordering, and in reporting. **Course** is configured under Management and used to group products in an order (terminals mark courses done; KMS shows courses in tabs)—courses are not assigned to products on the product form.

## Best practices

- Use a consistent **Reference** (code/SKU) so pricing, imports, and reporting stay clear.
- Assign every product to a **Product Group** so you can filter the outlet price grid when editing prices and use groups in layouts and menus.
- Set **Allergens** and **Product Tags** so terminals and ordering show the right information.
- Use **Popup Menu** on products that have options (e.g. coffee with milk choice) so the options open when the operator taps the product.
