description: "Configuration for day-to-day operations: layouts, products, pricing, sessions, operators, tenders, receipts, and how they link together"
---

## Overview

The **Management** subsection (under **Configuration > Management**) is where you configure everything that drives day-to-day operations at your sites and outlets: what products are sold, how they are priced, how the till screen looks, who can operate the till, how customers pay, and how receipts and menus behave. These settings are used by **terminals** (point-of-sale devices) and, where applicable, by **self-service kiosks** and **ordering** flows.

## Required permissions

Each page within Management has its own permission. See individual page documentation for specific permission requirements. Permissions are configured in **Admin > User Roles** under the **Configuration** tab in the **Management** section.

Because Management touches so many areas, it helps to understand how the main pieces link together before diving into individual pages. The sections below explain those links, then list every Management menu item and where it fits.

## How Management pieces link together

### Organisation: Sites, outlets, and outlet types

Your organisation is structured as **Sites** containing **Outlets**. Each outlet has an **Outlet Type** (e.g. counter, drive-through, table service). Outlet Type is configured under **Configuration > Management > Outlet Type** and is used to standardise how outlets of the same type behave. When you create or edit an outlet (under **Configuration** or site/outlet management), you assign it a site and an outlet type. Outlets also hold the links to **sessions**, **layouts**, **vision**, and **pricing** described below.

### Sessions: When the till is “open” and which price band and layout apply

**Sessions** define named operational periods (e.g. “Breakfast”, “Lunch”, “Evening”). Each session has a **Price Band** assigned to it. When a terminal at an outlet is running “in” a session, the outlet uses that session’s price band for product prices and can use different **layouts** for that session.

- **Sessions** — **Configuration > Management > Sessions**. Create sessions and assign each one a **Price Band**. Sessions are then linked to outlets: each outlet has a list of **outlet sessions**, and for each session you choose which **Layouts** the outlet uses (sales layout and, for table service, table layouts).
- **Price Band** — Determines which set of product prices the customer pays. So: **Session → Price Band**; when the till is in that session, it uses that price band. Product prices are set **per outlet and per price band** (see Products and pricing below).
- **Layouts** — The arrangement of buttons and content on the terminal screen. Layouts are **not** assigned to the outlet alone; they are assigned **per outlet and per session**. So the same outlet can show a “Breakfast” layout in the morning session and a “Lunch” layout in the afternoon session. You configure **Layouts** and **Table Layout** under Management; then on the **Outlet** form you configure **Outlet Sessions** and, for each session, choose the Sales layout and (if applicable) Table layouts.

So the chain is: **Outlet** → has **Outlet Sessions** (each session has a **Price Band** and **Layouts**) → when the terminal is in that session, it uses that session’s **Price Band** for pricing and those **Layouts** for the screen.

### Products and pricing: What you sell and what it costs per outlet and price band

**Products** are your sellable items. **Product Prices** define how much each product costs — and prices are set **per outlet and per price band**. So the same product can have one price at Outlet A for “Standard” price band and a different price at Outlet B or for “Happy Hour” price band.

- **Products** — **Configuration > Management > Products**. Create and maintain your product catalogue. Products can belong to **Product Groups**, have **Product Label** settings, **Allergen** information, **Product Tags**, and **Waste Reason** codes. **Product Challenge** (product restrictions) controls age verification or other checks when selling.
- **Product Prices** — **Configuration > Management > Product Prices**. Set prices per product, per **Outlet**, and per **Price Band**. When editing prices for an outlet, you can filter the product list by **Product Groups** and **Product Tags** to view and edit a subset of products. Product price import is by company, site, or outlet and file—it does not filter by product group or tag. Because sessions use a price band, the active session at an outlet determines which of these prices the customer pays.
- **Price Bands** — **Configuration > Management > Price Bands**. Define the bands (e.g. Standard, Member, Happy Hour). Each **Session** uses one price band; product prices are stored per price band per outlet.
- **Price Band Groups** — **Configuration > Management > Price Band Groups**. Group price bands (e.g. for reporting or for voucher rules that apply to a whole group).
- **Price Band Scheduler** — **Configuration > Management > Price Band Scheduler**. Schedule when a different price band applies (e.g. “Happy Hour” 4–6 pm). This works with sessions and outlets so that at the scheduled time the system can switch which price band (and thus which prices) are in effect.
- **Product Groups** — **Configuration > Management > Product Groups**. Organise products into groups; used in product prices (filter the outlet price grid when editing prices for an outlet), menus, and reporting. Not used when importing product prices.
- **Product Label** — **Configuration > Management > Product Label**. Configure how product names and labels appear on terminals.
- **Product Challenge** — **Configuration > Management > Product Challenge**. Product restrictions and age verification requirements.
- **Allergens**, **Course**, **Product Tags**, **Waste Reason** — Under **Configuration > Management**: configure allergens (attached to products), courses (used to group products in an order—terminals mark courses done, KMS shows courses in tabs at the top), tags for categorisation (attached to products), and waste reason codes for tracking waste. Used in terminals, reporting, and (where applicable) ordering and stock.

### Terminals: Where layouts, receipts, operators, and tenders come together

**Terminals** are the physical (or virtual) point-of-sale devices. Each terminal belongs to an **Outlet**. The terminal uses:

- **Layout** — Not set on the terminal itself; the outlet’s **Outlet Sessions** define which layout is used for each session (see Sessions above). So the terminal shows the layout for the session it is currently in.
- **Receipt** — **Configuration > Management > Receipts**. Each terminal has a **Receipt type** (Print) assigned; receipts define the receipt template and printing behaviour.
- **Resources** — **Configuration > Management > Resources**. Terminals can use a **Background image** (resource) for the till screen; the terminal configuration references the chosen resource.
- **Operators** — Staff who log in at the terminal. **Operators** and **Operator Roles** are configured under **Configuration > Management > Operators** and **Operator Roles**. When an operator logs in at a terminal, their **Operator Role** determines what they can do. Orders and terminal session cash are tied to the operator who served.
- **Tenders** — **Configuration > Management > Tenders**. Payment types (cash, card, etc.) used when taking payment at the terminal.
- **Menus** — **Configuration > Management > Menus** (sale popup menus). Popup menus that appear on the terminal during sale (e.g. “Would you like a drink?”). **Self Service Menu** (Management) configures menus for **legacy self-service terminals**; for kiosk and self-service ordering menus, see **Configuration > Ordering > Self Service Ordering** (Kiosk Menu, Kiosk Menu Group).

So: **Terminal** → belongs to **Outlet** → outlet has **Outlet Sessions** (each with **Layouts** and **Price Band**) → terminal uses **Receipt**, **Resource**, and **Tenders**; **Operators** log in and use **Operator Roles**; **Menus** define popups on the terminal.

### Supporting configuration: Receipts, resources, checklist, messaging

- **Receipts** — Receipt templates and print settings. Assigned per terminal (Receipt type). See Terminals above.
- **Resources** — Images and assets (e.g. terminal background). Used by terminals and other areas that reference resources.
- **Allergens** — Added or updated via **Import** and **Export** (bulk); assign to products on the Product form (Allergens tab). Displayed where allergen information is shown (e.g. terminals, ordering).
- **Course** — Course configuration for grouping products in an order; terminals mark courses as done; KMS shows courses in the tabs at the top.
- **Product Tags** — Used for filtering and categorisation (e.g. in Product Prices; filter option on some reports such as Outlet Product Sales and Product Mix Report under **Analytics > Reports**).
- **Waste Reason** — Reason codes when recording product waste (e.g. in stock or outlet waste).
- **Outlet Type** — Assigned to outlets; standardises behaviour by type. See Organisation above.
- **Checklist** — **Configuration > Management > Checklist**. Operational checklists (configuration and dashboard). Checklists appear when operators **open a session** at the till and must be completed before they can advance. Use the **Checklist Dashboard** for overall status; for line-level detail (operator, terminal, each task), go to **Analytics > Activity > Checklist** (Terminal Checklist report). Once a checklist is in use (has completions), its lines cannot be edited.
- **Messaging** (under Management) — **Send Message Templates**, **Terminal Message Templates**, **Send Message to POS**, **Message History**. Server and terminal message templates and sending messages to terminals in real time. Separate from **Configuration > Campaign** (member messaging and notification templates).
- **Pay at Table** — **Configuration > Management > Pay at Table > QR Code Generator**. QR code configs (name, outlet, account, optional logo/color/gratuity); generate a single QR (table number) or bulk QR images (ZIP). Requires the Pay at Table module.
- **Receipt Portal** — **Configuration > Management > Receipt Portal > QR Code Generator**. Generates QR codes for receipt portal access; requires the Receipt Portal module.

## Best practices

- **Set outlet type first**: When adding outlets, assign an Outlet Type so behaviour is consistent across similar outlets.
- **Sessions before layouts**: Create Sessions and assign each a Price Band; then on each Outlet configure Outlet Sessions and choose the Layouts (and table layouts if needed) for each session. Terminals then use the right layout and price band when they are in that session.
- **Price bands and product prices**: Define Price Bands, then set Product Prices per outlet and per price band. Use Price Band Scheduler if you need time-based price changes. Sessions determine which price band is active at the till.
- **Reuse layouts and resources**: Create layouts and resources once and assign them to multiple outlet/session combinations or terminals where appropriate.
- **Allergens**: Use Import to add or update allergens in bulk; assign them to products on the Product form (Allergens tab). Export for templates or backup.
- **Checklists**: Assign checklists to terminals so operators see them when opening a session; use the Checklist Dashboard for status by outlet and **Analytics > Activity > Checklist** for line-level completion detail.
