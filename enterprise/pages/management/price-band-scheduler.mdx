## Overview

Price Band Scheduler lets you **schedule when a different price band applies** (e.g. Happy Hour 4–6 pm, weekend member prices).

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Price Band Scheduler | Price Band Scheduler | Configuration (Management) |

**How it works:** You create schedules with **Events**. Each event defines which **Price Band** is used during a time range for selected outlets. During an event’s time range, the system uses that price band’s **Product Prices** for those outlets instead of the session’s default price band.

**Integration:** This works with **Sessions** and **Outlets** so you can switch prices by time without changing the session.

**Permissions:** You need the **Price Band Scheduler** permission to access this page.

## Using Price Band Scheduler

### Accessing Price Band Scheduler

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Price Band Scheduler** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing schedules

When you open the Price Band Scheduler page, you see a list of schedules. Each schedule has a **Name** and **Events** (time ranges and the price band to use). Choose a schedule from the list; its details and events load so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a schedule

1. On the Price Band Scheduler page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** for the schedule.
3. Configure **Events**: for each event, set the **Price Band** to use, **Start** and **End** date/time, and optionally **Repeats** (e.g. days of the week, repeats until). Add events for each time range when you want a different price band (e.g. Happy Hour 4–6 pm).
4. Configure **Availability**: select the **Outlets** (or sites) this schedule applies to.
5. Click Save.

### Editing a schedule

1. Open the Price Band Scheduler page and select the schedule from the list.
2. Change **Name**, add or edit **Events** (price band, start/end, repeats), or change **Availability** (outlets) as needed.
3. Click Save.

## How price band scheduler links

- **Price Bands**: Each event specifies which **Price Band** to use during that time range. Product prices are set per outlet and per price band on **Product Prices**.
- **Sessions**: Sessions still have a default price band; the scheduler **overrides** which price band is used at the scheduled time for the schedule’s outlets.
- **Outlets**: You select which outlets (or sites) the schedule applies to (**Availability**). Only those outlets use the scheduled price band during the event’s time range.

## Best practices

- Create **Price Bands** and set **Product Prices** per outlet and price band before creating scheduler events.
- Use clear schedule and event names (e.g. "Happy Hour", "Weekend member prices") so staff can see what each event does.
- Set **Repeats** for recurring events (e.g. every weekday 4–6 pm) so you don’t have to add many one-off events.
