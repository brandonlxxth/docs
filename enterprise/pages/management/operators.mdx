## Overview

Operators are **staff who log in at the till** (terminal). Each operator has a **Name** (and typically a PIN or credentials) and an **Operator Role**.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Operators | Operator | Configuration (Management) |

**How it works:** The operator role determines what the operator can do (permissions, capabilities). When an operator logs in at a terminal, their **Operator Role** is used for the session; orders and terminal session cash are tied to the operator who served.

**Analytics:** All terminal actions performed by an operator are linked to analytics. Reports that use operator data include: **Operator Product Sales** (product sales by operator), **Operator Performance** (operator events and activity), **Operator Top Events**, **Event Operator Statistics**, **Event Operator Performance**, **Event Operator Activity Sales Refund**, **Event Operator Activity Voids Cancels**, and others. You can filter or group by operator in many reports.

**Receipt Explorer and Z Report Explorer:** Operators appear on the **Receipt Explorer** (you can filter receipts by operator; each receipt shows the operator who served) and the **Z Report Explorer** (Z report details show the operator).

**Permissions:** You need the **Operator** permission to access this page.

## Using Operators

### Accessing Operators

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Operators** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing operators

When you open the Operators page, you see a list of operators. Each has a **Name** and **Operator Role**. Choose an operator from the list; their details load in the content area below so you can view or edit them.

### Creating an operator

1. On the Operators page, click the **+** icon.
2. **Details** tab: Enter a **Name**. Select **Operator Role** and **Security Type**. Enter **PIN** if required (when Security Type is PIN Swipe to Logon or PIN Swipe to Switch Operator). Optionally set **Short Name**, **Key**, **Reference**, **External Reference 1**, **External Reference 2**, and the checkboxes (Is Training Mode, Is Guest, Is External Audit) as shown.
3. **Outlets** tab: Optionally restrict which **Outlets** this operator can work at; leave unrestricted for all outlets.
4. Click Save.

### Editing an operator

1. Open the Operators page and select the operator from the list.
2. Change **Name**, **Operator Role**, **Security Type**, **PIN**, **Outlets**, or any other Details or Outlets tab settings as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can **Copy** an operator to create a new one based on them. You can **Import** operators when your role has the relevant permissions.

## How operators link

- **Operator Roles**: Each operator has one **Operator Role** (Configuration > Management > Operator Roles). The role defines permissions and capabilities (e.g. what they can sell, discount, void).
- **Terminals**: Operators log in at **Terminals**; the terminal uses the operator’s role for the session. Orders and terminal session cash record the **Operator** who served.
- **Outlets**: Operators may have **Outlet** overrides (which outlets they can work at) configured on the operator or role.
- **Reports**: Operator data is used in many reports (e.g. Operator Product Sales, Operator Performance, Event Operator Statistics). All terminal actions performed by an operator are linked to analytics.
- **Receipt Explorer**: You can filter receipts by operator; each receipt shows the operator who served.
- **Z Report Explorer**: Z report details show the operator.

## Best practices

- Create **Operator Roles** first, then create operators and assign a role to each.
- Use clear operator names (e.g. first name or staff code) so they are recognisable in reports, Receipt Explorer, and Z Report Explorer.
