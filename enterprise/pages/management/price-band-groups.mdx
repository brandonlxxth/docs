## Overview

Price Band Groups let you **group price bands** (e.g. "Member bands", "Promo bands").

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Price Band Groups | Price Band Group | Configuration (Management) |

**Where groups are used:** Groups are used for reporting, for voucher or promotion rules that apply to a whole group of price bands, and for **Layouts** (you can restrict a layout to certain price bands or price band groups).

**Permissions:** You need the **Price Band Group** permission to access this page.

## Using Price Band Groups

### Accessing Price Band Groups

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Price Band Groups** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing price band groups

When you open the Price Band Groups page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a price band group from the list; its details (name and which price bands belong to it) load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a price band group

1. On the Price Band Groups page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Member bands", "Promo bands").
3. Select which **Price Bands** belong to this group (checkboxes or multi-select).
4. Click Save.

### Editing a price band group

1. Open the Price Band Groups page and select the price band group from the list.
2. Change **Name** or which **Price Bands** are in the group as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can use **Usage** to see where the group is used (e.g. layouts, vouchers) before deleting. Groups that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas.

## Price band group fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the group (e.g. Member bands, Promo bands). |
| **Price Bands** | Which price bands belong to this group; select from the list. |

## How price band groups link

- **Price Bands**: Each group contains one or more **Price Bands** (Configuration > Management > Price Bands).
- **Layouts**: Layouts can be restricted to certain **Price Bands** or **Price Band Groups** (Layout form, Price Band / Price Band Group tab).
- **Vouchers and promotions**: Some voucher or promotion rules may apply to a **Price Band Group** (e.g. discount for all member bands).
- **Reporting**: Reports may group or filter by price band group.

## Best practices

- Create **Price Bands** first, then create groups and assign price bands to them.
- Use clear group names (e.g. "Member bands", "Happy hour bands") so staff can use them in layouts and promotions.
