## Overview

Sessions define **operational periods** (e.g. Breakfast, Lunch, Evening). Each session has a **Price Band** assigned to it. When a terminal at an outlet is running in a session, the outlet uses that session’s price band for product prices and uses the **layouts** assigned for that session (Sales layout and, for table service, Table layouts). Outlets are configured with **Outlet Sessions**: for each session you choose which layouts the outlet uses.

## Required permissions

## Using Sessions

### Accessing Sessions

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Sessions** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing sessions

When you open the Sessions page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a session from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a session

1. On the Sessions page, click the **+** icon.
2. **Details** tab: Enter a **Name**. Select the **Price Band** for this session (this determines which product prices the till uses when in this session). Optionally enter **External reference** fields.
3. **Self Checkout Availability** tab: Optionally enable **Availability** and set which **days of the week** the session is available, **Start time** and **End time**, **First order time** and **Last order time**, **Slot interval**, **Delay minutes**, and **Timeslot maximum order count**. Tick **Show times in ordering** if you want ordering to show these times.
4. Click Save.

### Editing a session

1. Open the Sessions page and select the session from the list.
2. Change **Name**, **Price Band**, external references, or **Self Checkout Availability** settings as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can use the **Usage** button to see where the session is used before deleting. Sessions that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from outlet configuration.

## How sessions link

- **Price Band**: Each session has one **Price Band**. Product prices are set per outlet and per price band; when the till is in this session, it uses this price band’s prices.
- **Outlet sessions**: On the **Outlet** form (Site/Outlet configuration), you configure **Outlet Sessions**. For each session you assign **Sales layout** and (if applicable) **Table layout 1**, **Table layout 2**, **Table layout 3**. The terminal at that outlet uses those layouts when it is in that session.
- **Ordering**: Session availability (days, times, first/last order time) is used by ordering and self-service when sessions are used to control when orders can be placed.

## Best practices

- Create sessions and assign a price band before configuring outlet sessions and layouts.
- Use clear session names (e.g. "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Evening") so staff can match them to outlet sessions and layouts.
- Use **Usage** before deleting to confirm no outlets or other features depend on the session.
