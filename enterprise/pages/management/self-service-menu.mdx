## Overview

This page configures **menus for legacy self-service terminals**—image-based popup menus used on certain kiosk hardware. If you use **Configuration > Ordering > Self Service Ordering** (Kiosk Menu, Kiosk Menu Group) for kiosk and mobile ordering, that is where most self-service menu configuration is done. This Management page is for the legacy self-service terminal menus only.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |

On this page you create and edit self-service popup models (resolution, products, product groups, images) that are used on legacy kiosk layouts.

You need the **Self Service Image Menu** permission to access this page.

## Using Self Service Menu

### Accessing Self Service Menu

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Self Service Menu** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing self-service menus

When you open the Self Service Menu page, you see a list of self-service menus. Choose a menu from the selector; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a self-service menu

1. On the Self Service Menu page, click the **+** icon (or use the create flow that opens the menu designer with self-service resolution).
2. Configure the menu: name, resolution (e.g. self-service image menu), and content (products, product groups, images) in the designer.
3. Click Save.

### Editing a self-service menu

1. Open the Self Service Menu page and select the menu from the list.
2. Change the name or menu content (items, order, images) as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can **Copy** an existing self-service menu to create a new one based on it.

## Self service menu fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the menu (e.g. Kiosk main menu, Kiosk drinks). |
| **Resolution** | Screen resolution for the menu (e.g. self-service image menu); should match your kiosk screens. |
| **Content** | Products, product groups, and images that make up the menu; configured in the designer. |

## How self-service menu links

- **Kiosk layouts**: Self-service menus are used in **Layouts** configured for kiosk/self-service (e.g. in the Layout Designer, Menus tab for self-service layouts). Kiosks at outlets use those layouts.
- **Products and Product Groups**: Menu content is built from **Products** and **Product Groups** (Configuration > Management > Products, Product Groups).

## Best practices

- Use a resolution that matches your kiosk screens when creating the menu.
- Name menus clearly (e.g. “Kiosk main menu”, “Kiosk drinks”) so they are easy to find when assigning to kiosk layouts.
