## Overview

Checklist lets you **define operational checklists** (e.g. opening procedures, closing procedures, cleaning tasks) and view a **Checklist Dashboard** with completion status and metrics.

**How it works:** You create checklists and add **lines** (tasks) here. Operators complete checklist items at the terminal; the dashboard shows which checklists have been completed, by whom, and when.

**Permissions:** You need the **Checklist** permission to access this page.

## Using Checklist

### Accessing Checklist

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Checklist** in the navigation menu. The submenu has:

- **Checklist > Configuration** — Create and edit checklists and their lines (tasks).
- **Checklist > Dashboard** — View checklist completion status and metrics.

### Checklist Configuration

#### Viewing checklists

When you open **Configuration > Management > Checklist > Configuration**, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a checklist from the list; its details and **lines** (tasks) load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

#### Creating a checklist

1. On the Checklist Configuration page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Opening procedures", "Closing checklist").
3. Add **lines** (tasks): click **Add line** (or equivalent) and enter each task description. Set order as needed.
4. Click Save.

#### Editing a checklist

1. Open the Checklist Configuration page and select the checklist from the list.
2. Change **Name** or add, remove, or reorder **lines** (tasks) as needed.
3. Click Save.

Checklist events (completions) are tied to **Operators** and **Terminals**; the dashboard shows who completed what and when.

### Checklist Dashboard

When you open **Configuration > Management > Checklist > Dashboard**, you see a dashboard with checklist completion status: which checklists have been completed, by which operator, at which terminal, and when. Use it to monitor compliance and completion rates.

## Checklist fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the checklist (e.g. Opening procedures, Closing checklist). |
| **Lines** (tasks) | Each line is a task; add, remove, and reorder. Operators see and complete these at the till. |

## How checklist links

- **Operators**: Checklist completions are recorded with the **Operator** who completed them (operator logs in at the terminal and completes the checklist).
- **Terminals**: Checklists are completed at **Terminals**; the dashboard can show completion by terminal.

## Best practices

- Use clear checklist names (e.g. "Opening", "Closing", "Cleaning") and clear task descriptions so operators know what to do.
- Review the Checklist Dashboard regularly to ensure checklists are being completed.
