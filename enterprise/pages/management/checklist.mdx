## Overview

Checklist lets you **define operational checklists** (e.g. opening procedures, closing procedures, cleaning tasks) and view a **Checklist Dashboard** with completion status and metrics.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Checklist | Checklist | Configuration (Management) |

**When operators see it:** Checklists appear **when operators open a session** at the till. Before they can advance (continue past the checklist), they are shown the checklist and must complete it.

**Viewing where completions happened:** Use the **Checklist Dashboard** (**Checklist > Dashboard**) to see completion status by outlet (checked vs unchecked counts). For line-level detail (checklist, operator, terminal, date/time, each task checked/unchecked), go to **Analytics > Activity > Checklist**—that opens the Terminal Checklist report filter (date range, site/outlet); run the report to see where checklists have been completed.

**Data integrity:** Once a checklist has received feedback (operator completions), its **lines can no longer be edited**—the form shows lines as read-only and you cannot add, remove, or reorder them. This preserves data integrity for completed checklists.

**Permissions:** You need the **Checklist** permission to access this page.

## Using Checklist

### Accessing Checklist

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Checklist** in the navigation menu. The submenu has:

- **Checklist > Configuration** — Create and edit checklists and their lines (tasks).
- **Checklist > Dashboard** — View checklist completion status and metrics.

### Checklist Configuration

#### Viewing checklists

When you open **Configuration > Management > Checklist > Configuration**, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a checklist from the list; its details and **lines** (tasks) load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

#### Creating a checklist

1. On the Checklist Configuration page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Opening procedures", "Closing checklist").
3. Add **lines** (tasks): click **Add line** (or equivalent) and enter each task description. Set order as needed.
4. Click Save.

#### Editing a checklist

1. Open the Checklist Configuration page and select the checklist from the list.
2. Change **Name** or add, remove, or reorder **lines** (tasks) as needed—**only if the checklist has not yet received feedback**. Once it has received feedback (completions), lines are read-only and cannot be edited.
3. Click Save.

Checklist events (completions) are tied to **Operators** and **Terminals**. Use the **Checklist Dashboard** or **Terminal Checklist** report to see where completions happened.

### Checklist Dashboard

When you open **Configuration > Management > Checklist > Dashboard**, you see completion status by outlet: checked vs unchecked counts per outlet. Use it to see **where** checklists have been completed and to monitor compliance. For line-level detail (checklist, operator, terminal, date/time, each task checked/unchecked), go to **Analytics > Activity > Checklist** to open the Terminal Checklist report; set date range and site/outlet, then run the report.

## Checklist fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the checklist (e.g. Opening procedures, Closing checklist). |
| **Lines** (tasks) | Each line is a task; add, remove, and reorder. Operators see and complete these at the till. Once the checklist has received feedback, lines are read-only and cannot be edited (data integrity). |

## How checklist links

- **Session open**: When an operator **opens a session** at the till, the checklist is shown; they must complete it **before they can advance** (continue past the checklist).
- **Checklist Dashboard** and **Terminal Checklist** report: Use the Dashboard (Checklist > Dashboard) or go to **Analytics > Activity > Checklist** to run the Terminal Checklist report and see where checklists have been completed (by outlet, terminal, operator, date).
- **Operators**: Checklist completions are recorded with the **Operator** who completed them.
- **Terminals**: Checklists are completed at **Terminals**; the dashboard and report show completion by terminal.

## Best practices

- Use clear checklist names (e.g. "Opening", "Closing", "Cleaning") and clear task descriptions so operators know what to do.
- Review the **Checklist Dashboard** and **Terminal Checklist** report regularly to see where checklists have been completed and to ensure compliance.
