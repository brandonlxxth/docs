## Overview

Course lets you **define courses** (e.g. Starters, Mains, Desserts, Drinks) used to **group products in an order**.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Course | Course | Configuration (Management) |

**How it works:** Courses are used to group products in an order. **Terminals** can use this to **mark courses as done**. **KMS** (Kitchen Management Systems) show courses in the **tabs at the top**. You create and edit course definitions here (name, sequence); they are then available for order grouping, terminal course-done behaviour, and KMS display.

**Permissions:** You need the **Course** permission to access this page.

## Using Course

### Accessing Course

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Course** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing courses

When you open the Course page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a course from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a course

1. On the Course page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Starters", "Mains", "Desserts", "Drinks"). Optionally set **Sequence** and **Is group sequence**.
3. Click Save.

### Editing a course

1. Open the Course page and select the course from the list.
2. Change the **Name**, **Sequence**, or **Is group sequence** as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can use **Usage** to see where the course is used (orders, terminals, KMS, etc.) before deleting. Courses that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas.

## Course fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the course (e.g. Starters, Mains, Desserts, Drinks). |
| **Sequence** | Optional order/sequence number for the course (e.g. for display order). |
| **Is group sequence** | When ticked, the sequence is used for grouping (e.g. for preparation or display). |

## How course links

- **Orders**: Courses group products in an order so items are organised by course (e.g. Starters, Mains, Desserts).
- **Terminals**: Terminals can use courses to **mark courses as done** (e.g. when a course is sent or completed).
- **KMS**: Kitchen Management Systems show courses in the **tabs at the top** so kitchen staff see orders by course.

## Best practices

- Use clear course names (e.g. "Starters", "Mains", "Desserts", "Drinks") so staff and KMS can group and display orders clearly.
- Check **Usage** before deleting a course.
