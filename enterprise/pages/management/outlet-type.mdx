## Overview

Outlet types are **purely labels**. You define names (e.g. Counter, Drive-through, Table service) that you can assign to **Outlets**. They do not change behaviour or configuration—they are for organisation and identification only.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Outlet Type | Outlet Type | Configuration (Management) |

**How it works:** When you create or edit an **Outlet** (under Site/Outlet configuration), you assign one **Outlet Type** to it. That label is stored with the outlet.

**Reports:** Some reports group or filter by outlet type (e.g. Outlet type revenue summary, Outlet type product sales), so you can compare or analyse data by the label you assigned.

**Permissions:** You need the **Outlet Type** permission to access this page.

## Using Outlet Type

### Accessing Outlet Type

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Outlet Type** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing outlet types

When you open the Outlet Type page, you see a list of outlet types. Each has a **Name**. You can add, edit, or delete outlet types (delete only when the type is not in use).

### Creating an outlet type

1. On the Outlet Type page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Counter", "Drive-through", "Table service").
3. Click Save.

### Editing an outlet type

1. Open the Outlet Type page and click the outlet type you want to edit (or use the edit action).
2. Change the **Name** as needed.
3. Click Save.

### Deleting an outlet type

You can delete an outlet type only when no outlet is assigned that type. Remove or change the outlet type from all outlets first, then delete.

## Outlet type fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Label for the outlet type (e.g. Counter, Drive-through, Table service). Outlet types are labels only; they have no effect on behaviour or configuration. |

## How outlet type links

- **Outlets**: When you create or edit an **Outlet** (under Site/Outlet configuration), you assign a **Site** and an **Outlet Type**. The outlet type is stored as a label on the outlet.
- **Reports**: Some reports group or filter by **Outlet Type** (e.g. Outlet type revenue summary, Outlet type product sales), so the label you assign affects how data appears in those reports.

## Best practices

- Define outlet types before adding outlets so you can assign a label when creating each outlet.
- Use consistent names (e.g. "Counter", "Kiosk", "Table service") so reports and filtering are clear.
