## Overview

Operator Roles define **what operators can do** when they log in at the till: permissions (e.g. discount, void, refund), outlet access (which outlets they can work at), and other capabilities.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Operator Roles | Operator Role | Configuration (Management) |

**How it works:** Each **Operator** is assigned one **Operator Role**. When an operator logs in at a terminal, their role determines what actions they can perform and which outlets (and optionally terminals) they can use.

**Permissions:** You need the **Operator Role** permission to access this page.

## Using Operator Roles

### Accessing Operator Roles

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Operator Roles** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing operator roles

When you open the Operator Roles page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose an operator role from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it (Name, Restriction, and sections: Options, Reports, Stock, Tender, Training).

### Creating an operator role

1. On the Operator Roles page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Cashier", "Supervisor", "Manager"). Optionally set **Restriction** (User Role Restriction) so the role applies only when the user/outlet is subject to that restriction.
3. In **Options**, **Reports**, **Stock**, **Tender**, and **Training** sections, tick the checkboxes for the permissions this role should have (see reference tables below).
4. Click Save.

### Editing an operator role

1. Open the Operator Roles page and select the operator role from the list.
2. Change **Name**, **Restriction**, or any permission checkboxes in Options, Reports, Stock, Tender, or Training as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can **Copy** an operator role to create a new one based on it. Use **Usage** to see which operators use this role before deleting. Roles that are in use cannot be deleted until operators are reassigned to another role.

## How operator roles link

- **Operators**: Each **Operator** (Configuration > Management > Operators) has one **Operator Role**. When they log in at a terminal, their role’s permissions apply. Outlet access can be set per operator on the Operator form (Outlets tab).
- **Terminals**: Operators log in at **Terminals**; the terminal uses the operator’s role for the session.
- **Restriction** (Admin): Optionally an operator role can be tied to a **Restriction** (Configuration > Admin > Restriction) so the role applies only when the user or outlet is subject to that restriction.

## Best practices

- Create operator roles before creating operators so you can assign a role to each operator.
- Use clear role names (e.g. "Cashier", "Supervisor", "Manager") and set permissions to match your policy (e.g. supervisors can void, managers can override price).
- Check **Usage** before deleting an operator role.
