## Overview

Product Groups let you **organise products into groups** (e.g. Drinks, Food, Sides). You assign products to groups when editing a **Product** (Configuration > Management > Products).

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Product Groups | Product Group | Configuration (Management) |

**Where groups are used:** Groups are used in **Product Prices** (filter the outlet price grid when editing prices for an outlet—import does not use product group filters), in **Layouts** (product shortcut tiles can show a product group), in **Menus** (menu content can be built from product groups), and in reporting.

**Permissions:** You need the **Product Group** permission to access this page.

## Using Product Groups

### Accessing Product Groups

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Product Groups** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing product groups

When you open the Product Groups page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a product group from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a product group

1. On the Product Groups page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Drinks", "Food", "Sides"). Optionally set **Parent group**, **Layout tile colour**, **External reference 1**, **External reference 2**, and **External reference 3**.
3. Click Save.

### Editing a product group

1. Open the Product Groups page and select the product group from the list.
2. Change **Name**, **Parent group**, **Layout tile colour**, **External references**, or other settings as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can use **Usage** to see where the group is used (layouts, menus, product prices, etc.) before deleting. Groups that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas.

## Product group fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the product group (e.g. Drinks, Food, Sides). |
| **Parent group** | Optional parent product group for hierarchy (e.g. "Drinks" under "Beverages"); choose **Top level** for no parent. |
| **Layout tile colour** | Fill colour of the product group tile when shown on a layout (e.g. till screen). |
| **Layout tile text colour** | Text colour of the product group tile when shown on a layout. |
| **External reference 1** | Optional reference for integration or reporting. |
| **External reference 2** | Optional reference for integration or reporting. |
| **External reference 3** | Optional reference for integration or reporting. |

## How product groups link

- **Products**: Each product can belong to one or more **Product Groups** (or groups reference products). Products are configured under **Configuration > Management > Products**.
- **Product Prices**: On **Product Prices**, when editing prices for an outlet, you can filter the product list by **Product Groups** to view and edit prices for products in selected groups. Product price import does not filter by product group.
- **Layouts**: In the Layout Designer, **Product shortcuts** tiles can show a **Product Group** (so one tile shows all products in that group).
- **Menus**: **Menus** (sale popup) and **Self Service Menu** (legacy kiosk) content can be built from product groups.

## Best practices

- Create product groups before or as you add products so you can assign products to groups and use groups in layouts and menus.
- Use clear names (e.g. "Drinks", "Hot food", "Sides") so staff can find them when building layouts and setting prices.
- Use **Usage** before deleting a product group.
