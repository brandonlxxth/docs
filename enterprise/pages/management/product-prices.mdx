## Overview

Product Prices let you set **how much each product costs** at each **Outlet** and for each **Price Band**.

**How prices are used:** **Sessions** use a **Price Band**. When a terminal at an outlet is running in a session, it uses that session’s price band—so the prices you set here (per outlet and per price band) are what the customer pays.

**Editing outlet prices:** When editing prices for an outlet, you can filter the product list by **Product Groups** and **Product Tags** to view and edit a subset of products. The grid shows products and their prices per price band for that outlet. You can also update **individual product prices** on the **Product** page by searching for the desired product and editing its prices there.

**Import:** Product price import is by company, site, or outlet and file. Import does **not** filter by product group or tag; use it for bulk updates across many products, outlets, and price bands.

**Permissions:** You need the **Product Price Outlet** permission to access this page. Import/export may require **Product Price Import Export**.

## Using Product Prices

### Accessing Product Prices

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Product Prices** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing product prices

When you open the Product Prices page:

- Choose an **Outlet** (and optionally filter by **Product Groups** and **Product Tags**).
- The page shows a grid or list of products and their prices **per Price Band** for that outlet.
- You can search and sort to find products and edit prices.

### Setting prices

1. On the Product Prices page, select the **Outlet** you want to set prices for.
2. Optionally filter by **Product Groups** and **Product Tags** to limit the list to a subset of products.
3. For each product and each **Price Band**, enter or change the price (and any other price fields, e.g. cost, tax).
4. Click Save (or save per row/section as the UI allows).

You can also update prices for a **single product** on the **Product** page (**Configuration > Management > Products**): search for the product, open it, and edit its prices there.

**Import and export:** You can **Import** prices (e.g. from a file) and **Export** when your role has the relevant permissions. Import lets you update prices for many products, outlets, and price bands in one go.

## Product price fields reference

| Field | Where | What it does |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Outlet** | Page selector | The outlet whose prices you are viewing or editing. |
| **Product Groups** | Filter | Limits the product list to products in the selected groups (outlet price grid only; not used in import). |
| **Product Tags** | Filter | Limits the product list to products with the selected tags (outlet price grid only; not used in import). |
| **Price Band** | Grid | Each column (or band) represents a price band; the till uses the band assigned to the current session. |
| **Price** | Grid | Selling price for the product in this price band at this outlet. |
| **Cost** | Grid | — |
| **Tax** | Grid | Tax rate applied to the product price. |

## How product prices link

- **Sessions:** Each **Session** has a **Price Band**. When the till is in that session, it uses that price band’s prices for the current outlet.
- **Outlets:** Prices are stored per outlet; each outlet can have different prices for the same product and price band.
- **Price Bands:** You define price bands under **Configuration > Management > Price Bands**. Product prices are stored per price band per outlet.
- **Products, Product Groups, Product Tags:** When editing outlet prices, you filter the product list by product group and tag to view and edit a subset. Products and groups are configured under **Products** and **Product Groups**. Import does not use product group or tag filters.

## Best practices

- Set **Price Bands** and **Sessions** first, then set product prices per outlet and price band.
- Use **Product Groups** and **Product Tags** to filter the outlet price grid when editing prices for a subset of products (e.g. all drinks, all member prices).
- Use **Import** for large price updates (by company, site, or outlet and file); check the import result before committing.
