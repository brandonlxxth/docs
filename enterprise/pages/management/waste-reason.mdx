## Overview

Waste Reason lets you **define reason codes** used when recording product waste (e.g. "Spoilage", "Damaged", "Expired", "Over-preparation").

**How it works:** You create waste reasons here; they are then available when staff record waste at the till or in stock/outlet waste. Waste reasons are used in **Outlet Product Waste** and stock waste recording so you can track why product was wasted.

**Permissions:** You need the **Waste Reason** permission to access this page.

## Using Waste Reason

### Accessing Waste Reason

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Waste Reason** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing waste reasons

When you open the Waste Reason page, you see a list of waste reasons. Each has a **Name**. You can add, edit, or delete waste reasons (delete only when the reason is not in use). You can **Import** and **Export** waste reasons when your role has the relevant permissions.

### Creating a waste reason

1. On the Waste Reason page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Spoilage", "Damaged", "Expired", "Over-preparation").
3. Click Save.

### Editing a waste reason

1. Open the Waste Reason page and click the waste reason you want to edit (or use the edit action).
2. Change the **Name** as needed.
3. Click Save.

## Waste reason fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the waste reason (e.g. Spoilage, Damaged, Expired, Over-preparation). |

## How waste reason links

- **Products and waste recording**: When staff record product waste (e.g. at the till, in **Outlet Product Waste**, or stock waste), they select a **Waste Reason**. The reason is stored with the waste record for reporting and tracking.
- **Reporting**: Waste reports can group or filter by waste reason so you can see why product was wasted.

## Best practices

- Use clear reason names (e.g. "Spoilage", "Damaged", "Expired") so staff choose the right reason when recording waste.
- Create a small set of reasons that cover your main waste categories so reporting is consistent.
