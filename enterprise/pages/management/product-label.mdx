## Overview

Product Label is for **printing barcode labels** to put on shelves (e.g. on product displays or stock). You choose a **Price Band** and **Outlet**, add products (with a label count), and print. Each product must have a **valid price** for the selected outlet and price band, and at least one **barcode**—if a product has multiple barcodes, the **first** is used. Label dimensions (width, height, margins) can be customised; the **base measurement** (default dimensions) is stored at the **top level of hierarchy** (company level) and can be updated from this page using **Save Default Measurements**.

You need the **Product** permission to access this page.

## Using Product Label

### Accessing Product Label

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Product Label** in the navigation menu.

### Printing labels

1. Select **Price Band** and **Outlet** so prices are correct for that combination.
2. Optionally adjust **label dimensions** (width, height, margins in mm). Click **Save Default Measurements** to store these as the base configuration at the top level of hierarchy.
3. Select a **Product** and enter **Label count**. The product must have a valid price for the selected outlet and price band, and at least one barcode (the first barcode is used if there are multiple).
4. Add the label to the print list and print when ready.

The **Request** tab shows label requests sent from **handheld terminals (HHTs)**; each request contains the labels that were requested from the HHT. You can view or reprint these requests from here.

### Base measurement (top level of hierarchy)

The default label dimensions (width, height, top/bottom/left/right margins in mm) are stored at the **top level of hierarchy** (company level). When you open the Product Label page, those values are loaded. Changing the dimensions and clicking **Save Default Measurements** updates that base configuration so it applies for future label prints.

## Product label fields reference

| Field | Where | What it does |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Label width (mm)** | Editor | Width of the printed label in millimetres (base measurement; stored at top level of hierarchy when you save default). |
| **Label height (mm)** | Editor | Height of the printed label in millimetres (base measurement; stored at top level of hierarchy when you save default). |
| **Top margin (mm)** | Editor | Top margin for label content. |
| **Bottom margin (mm)** | Editor | Bottom margin for label content. |
| **Left margin (mm)** | Editor | Left margin for label content. |
| **Right margin (mm)** | Editor | Right margin for label content. |
| **Save Default Measurements** | Editor | Saves the current dimensions as the base configuration at the top level of hierarchy. |
| **Price Band** | Editor | Price band used to look up product prices; products must have a valid price for this band and the selected outlet. |
| **Outlet** | Editor | Outlet used for product prices; products must have a valid price for this outlet and the selected price band. |
| **Product** | Editor | Product to print labels for; must have at least one barcode (first is used if multiple) and a valid price for the selected outlet and price band. |
| **Label count** | Editor | Number of identical labels to add for the selected product. |

## How product label links

- **Products**: Each product must have a **valid price** for the selected **Outlet** and **Price Band**, and at least one **barcode** (the first barcode is used if there are multiple). Configure products and prices under **Configuration > Management > Products** and **Product Prices**.
- **Price Bands**, **Outlets**: You choose one price band and one outlet when printing; the system uses that combination to get the product price shown on the label.
- **Top level of hierarchy**: The base measurement (default label dimensions) is stored at the top level of hierarchy (company level) and is loaded when you open the Product Label page; **Save Default Measurements** updates it.

## Best practices

- Ensure products have **prices set** for the outlet and price band you use when printing labels.
- Ensure products have at least one **barcode**; if you use multiple barcodes, the first is used for the label.
- Set the **base dimensions** (via Save Default Measurements) to match your physical label stock so prints are consistent.
