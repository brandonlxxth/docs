## Overview

Resources are **images and assets** used across the system: layout background images, receipt logos, and other images referenced by **Layouts**, **Table Layout**, **Terminals**, and **Receipts**.

**How it works:** You upload or create resources here, then select them when configuring a layout (background image), terminal (background image), or receipt (logo).

**Permissions:** You need the **Resource** permission to access this page.

## Using Resources

### Accessing Resources

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Resources** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing resources

When you open the Resources page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a resource from the list; its details (name, type, image) load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a resource

1. On the Resources page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name**. Select **Type** (e.g. layout background, receipt logo, other) as shown. Type cannot be changed after save.
3. Upload or set the **Image** (file) for this resource.
4. Click Save.

### Editing a resource

1. Open the Resources page and select the resource from the list.
2. Change **Name** or replace the **Image** as needed. **Type** cannot be changed after creation.
3. Click Save.

You can use **Usage** to see where the resource is used (layouts, terminals, receipts, etc.) before deleting. Resources that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas.

## Resource fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the resource (e.g. Layout background main, Receipt logo). |
| **Type** | Type of resource (e.g. layout background, receipt logo); set at creation and cannot be changed. |
| **Image** | The image file; used by layouts, terminals, or receipts depending on type. |

## How resources link

- **Layouts**: **Layouts** and **Table Layout** can have a **Layout background image** (or **Background resource**) selected from Resources.
- **Terminals**: **Terminals** can have a **Background image** (resource) for the till screen.
- **Receipts**: **Receipts** (Print) can have a **Logo** (resource).

## Best practices

- Use clear resource names (e.g. "Layout background main", "Receipt logo") so staff can find them when configuring layouts, terminals, and receipts.
- Choose the correct **Type** at creation; it cannot be changed later.
- Use **Usage** before deleting a resource.
