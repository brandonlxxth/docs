## Overview

Table Layout is the tool for putting **floor plans visually on screen**. You design a layout that shows the tables (or zones) on the till so operators see a visual map of the floor. When they tap a table on that screen, they can open a tab for that table, add orders, split bills, merge tabs, and manage table service from one place.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Table Layout | Layout | Configuration (Management) |

**Assignment:** Like standard Layouts, table layouts are assigned **per outlet and per session**. On the **Outlet** form, under **Outlet Sessions**, you can assign **Table layout 1**, **Table layout 2**, and **Table layout 3** for each session (in addition to the Sales layout).

**Permissions:** You need the **Layout** permission to access Table Layout.

## Using Table Layout

### Accessing Table Layout

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Table Layout** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing table layouts

When you open the Table Layout page, you see a **selector at the top**, a **+** icon, and a **Copy** button. Choose a table layout from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a table layout

1. On the Table Layout page, click the **+** icon.
2. **Details** tab: Enter a **Name**. Choose **Layout resolution** (cannot be changed after save). Optionally set **Layout background image** (from **Resources**) and **Restriction**.
3. Click Save. After saving, the **Designer** tab appears so you can add and arrange table elements.
4. In the **Designer** tab, configure the table layout as needed, then Save.

### Editing and copying

- **Edit**: Select the table layout from the list and change **Name**, **Layout background image**, **Restriction**, or Designer content, then Save.
- **Copy**: Click the **Copy** button, choose a source table layout from the list that opens, and save to create a new table layout based on it.

## Table layout fields reference

| Field | Tab | What it does |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| **Name** | Details | Display name of the table layout (e.g. Table service main, Table service 2). |
| **Layout resolution** | Details | Screen resolution; set at creation and cannot be changed. |
| **Layout background image** | Details | Image from **Resources** used as the background. |
| **Restriction** | Details | When set, only users/outlets without this restriction see the layout. |
| **Designer** | Designer | Add and arrange table elements (tables/zones) on the floor plan. |

## How table layout links

- **Outlet sessions**: When you configure an **Outlet**, under **Outlet Sessions** for each session you can set **Table layout 1**, **Table layout 2**, and **Table layout 3**. Terminals at that outlet use these when in table-service mode for that session.
- **Resources**: Background image comes from **Configuration > Management > Resources**.

## Best practices

- Use clear names (e.g. "Table service main", "Table service 2") so staff can identify them when assigning to outlet sessions.
- Set resolution at creation to match your terminal screens; it cannot be changed later.
- Use **Copy** to create variations from an existing table layout.
