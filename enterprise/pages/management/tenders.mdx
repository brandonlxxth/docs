## Overview

Tenders are **payment types** used when taking payment at the till (e.g. Cash, Card/EFT, Account, Other). You configure each tender with a name, type, optional layout colours for the terminal tile, exchange rate for foreign currency, and options such as overpayments behaviour (change, gratuity, forfeit, not allowed), cash drawer, session close declare, and reporting.

**Overpayments**: Only certain overpayment types are shown in the **Options** tab depending on the **Type** you select. For example, **Cash** and **Cash Foreign Currency** show **Change** (and Not allowed); **EFT** shows **Gratuity**; **Other** shows **Gratuity** and **Forfeit**; **Account** and some other types show **Forfeit** or **Not allowed** only. Choose the tender type first—the overpayment options that appear will match that type.

You need the **Tender** permission to access this page.

## Using Tenders

### Accessing Tenders

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Tenders** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing tenders

When you open the Tenders page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a tender from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a tender

1. On the Tenders page, click the **+** icon.
2. **Details** tab: Enter a **Name**. Select **Type** (e.g. Cash, EFT, Account, Other). Optionally set **Reference**, **Name (alt)**, **Layout tile colour**, and **External reference** fields. Set **Minimum value** and **Maximum value** if needed. For foreign currency types, set **Exchange rate**.
3. **Options** tab: Set **Overpayments**. The overpayment options shown (Change, Gratuity, Forfeit, Not allowed) depend on the **Type** you selected—only the options that apply to that tender type are displayed. Optionally enable **Cash drawer**, **Session close declare**, **Session close include variance**, **Exclude from tender total**, **Override print**, **Email receipt** (if not Portugal), **Report taxable**, **Cost centre**, and **Allow empty order** (for Account type).
4. Click Save.

### Editing a tender

1. Open the Tenders page and select the tender from the list.
2. Change **Name**, **Type**, colours, values, or **Options** as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can use the **Usage** button to see where the tender is used (layouts, vouchers, accounts). Tenders that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas.

## How tenders link

- **Layouts**: Tenders can be added as tiles on a **Layout** so operators see payment buttons for each tender.
- **Terminals**: When an operator tenders a sale, they choose a tender; the terminal uses the tender’s options (e.g. cash drawer, print, report taxable).
- **Vouchers**: Vouchers reference tenders (e.g. for payment rules); the **Usage** button shows how many vouchers use a tender.
- **Accounts**: Account tender type is used for member/account payments; **Allow empty order** can be set for account tenders.

## Best practices

- Use clear names (e.g. "Cash", "Card", "Member account") so operators recognise them on the till.
- Set **Overpayments** to match your policy; the options shown depend on the tender type (e.g. Change for Cash, Gratuity for EFT).
- Check **Usage** before deleting a tender.
