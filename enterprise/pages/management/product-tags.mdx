## Overview

Product Tags let you **tag products** for categorisation (e.g. "Vegetarian", "Spicy", "Promo").

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Product Tags | Product Tag | Configuration (Management) |

**Where tags are used:** Tags are used in **Product Prices** (filter the outlet price grid when editing prices for an outlet—import does not filter by tag), on **Products** (assign tags to products on the Product form), and in reporting.

**Permissions:** You need the **Product Tag** permission to access this page.

## Using Product Tags

### Accessing Product Tags

Navigate to **Configuration > Management > Product Tags** in the navigation menu.

### Viewing product tags

When you open the Product Tags page, you see a **selector at the top** and a **+** icon. Choose a tag from the list; its details load in the content area below so you can view or edit it.

### Creating a product tag

1. On the Product Tags page, click the **+** icon.
2. Enter a **Name** (e.g. "Vegetarian", "Spicy", "Promo", "New").
3. Click Save.

### Editing a product tag

1. Open the Product Tags page and select the tag from the list.
2. Change the **Name** as needed.
3. Click Save.

You can use **Usage** to see where the tag is used (products, product prices, etc.) before deleting. Tags that are in use cannot be deleted until they are removed from those areas.

## Product tag fields reference

| Field | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the tag (e.g. Vegetarian, Spicy, Promo, New). |

## How product tags link

- **Products**: On the **Product** form (Configuration > Management > Products), you can assign one or more **Product Tags** to a product.
- **Product Prices**: On **Product Prices**, when editing prices for an outlet, you can filter the product list by **Product Tags** to view and edit prices for products with a given tag. Product price import does not filter by tag.
- **Reporting**: In **Analytics > Reports**, some reports include **Product Tag** as a filter option (alongside other filters such as **Product Group**, outlet, date range). For example, **Outlet Product Sales** and **Product Mix Report** offer filter options that can include Product Tag—use the Product Tag filter to limit results to products that have a selected tag (e.g. "Promo", "Vegetarian"). Check each report’s filters in Analytics > Reports for the full list.

## Best practices

- Use clear tag names (e.g. "Vegetarian", "Spicy", "Promo") so staff can filter and report consistently.
- Assign tags to products so you can use tag-based filtering in Product Prices and reporting.
- Check **Usage** before deleting a product tag.
