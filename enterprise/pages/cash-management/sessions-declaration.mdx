## Overview

**Sessions Declaration** (Cash Management > Sessions > Declaration) lists terminal sessions and their cash declaration status. When an operator closes a session on a POS terminal, any tender with **Session Declaration** enabled (usually **Cash**) must be declared in the Management Portal. You use this page to find sessions with status **Declaration Required**, enter the physically counted amount (**Declared at Cash Office**), and optionally select a **Variance Reason** if the count differs from the terminal amount. Once saved, the session can be banked in [Sessions Banking](/enterprise/pages/cash-management/sessions-banking).

Only tenders that have **Session Declaration** enabled appear for declaration. Non-declared tenders (e.g. EFT/card) do not require a cash declaration and are not shown in the declaration form.

## Completing a declaration

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter sessions">
  Set **Session Open Date Range** to the date range you want. Optionally filter by **Outlet**. The table lists sessions in that range.
</Step>

<Step title="Find sessions that need declaration">
  Locate rows with status **Declaration Required**.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the declaration form">
  Click the **Pencil** icon on the session row. The declaration form opens with session details (outlet, terminal, session name, open/close date and time, open/close operator).
</Step>

<Step title="Enter counted amount">
  For each tender that requires declaration (e.g. Cash), you see **Declared at Terminal** (from the terminal). Enter **Declared at Cash Office** — the amount you physically counted and verified at the cash office.
</Step>

<Step title="Add variance reason if needed">
  If the two amounts differ, the **Variance** is shown. Select a **Variance Reason** from the dropdown (the list comes from [Reason Codes](/enterprise/pages/cash-management/reason-codes)). This is optional but recommended for auditing.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click the **green tick** to save. The session then becomes available for banking. If you need to correct the declaration, open it again with the Pencil and change the value or reason; you can edit until the session is banked.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing a declaration (read-only)

Click the **Eye** icon on a session row to open the declaration in **read-only** mode. Use this to review completed or banked sessions (e.g. for auditing). If the session has already been banked, the form also shows **Banked At**, **Banked By**, **Bag Number**, **Reference**, and **Reference 2**.

## Notes

- Sessions with status **Session In Progress** cannot be declared until the operator has closed the session on the terminal.
- Complete all **Declaration Required** sessions promptly so they can be banked.
- After banking, declaration fields are read-only; use the Eye icon to view details.
