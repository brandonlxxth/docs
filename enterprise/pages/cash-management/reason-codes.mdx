## Overview

**Reason Codes** (variance reason codes) are used when the **Declared at Cash Office** amount does not match the amount **Declared at Terminal** for a session. Staff select a reason from this list when completing a [Sessions Declaration](/enterprise/pages/cash-management/sessions-declaration) so that variances are justified and auditable. You maintain the list of reason codes here: create new codes, edit names, and delete codes that are not in use.

## Accessing Reason Codes

Navigate to **Cash Management > Reason Codes**.

## Managing reason codes

The page shows a dropdown of existing reason codes. Use **Create** to add a new code, or select a code and **Edit** to change it.

### Creating a reason code

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Reason Codes">
  Go to **Cash Management > Reason Codes**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create new">
  Click **Create**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter name">
  Enter a **Name** for the reason (e.g. "Counting error", "Short drop", "Overage - extra cash found"). This is the text shown in the variance reason dropdown when completing declarations.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Editing a reason code

1. Select the reason code from the dropdown.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Change the **Name** as needed.
4. Click **Save**.

### Deleting a reason code

1. Select the reason code and click **Edit**.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the card toolbar.
3. Confirm the deletion.

You cannot delete a reason code that is **in use** (e.g. already selected on one or more declarations). Remove or change those declarations first, or leave the code in place for historical accuracy.

## Reason code fields reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | Label shown in the variance reason dropdown when completing a declaration (e.g. "Counting error", "Short drop", "Overage"). |

## When reason codes are used

When a user completes a cash declaration in **Cash Management > Sessions > Declaration**, they enter the **Declared at Cash Office** amount (the physically counted amount). If it differs from the **Declared at Terminal** amount, the system shows a **Variance**. The user can select a **Variance Reason** from the dropdown; the options in that dropdown are the reason codes you maintain here. Selecting a reason helps with reconciliation and auditing.
