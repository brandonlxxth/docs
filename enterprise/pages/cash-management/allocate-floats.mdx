## Overview

**Allocate Floats** lets you assign cash floats to outlets so operators have starting cash for their tills. You choose a **site**, then set the float amount for each outlet under that site. The page shows the **Cash Office Floats Total** (total float available for the site), **Allocated to Outlets** (sum of what you have allocated), and **Unallocated** (remaining). You cannot allocate more than the total available; the system will warn you and block save if the allocated total exceeds the cash office total.

## Accessing Allocate Floats

Navigate to **Cash Management > Allocate Floats**.

## Allocating floats

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a site">
  Use the **Site** dropdown at the top to select the site whose outlets you want to allocate floats for.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the allocation form">
  Click **Create** (for a new allocation) or **Edit** (if the site already has float data). The form opens with the site name and three summary values: **Cash Office Floats Total**, **Allocated to Outlets**, and **Unallocated**.
</Step>

<Step title="Set outlet float amounts">
  In **Allocate Outlet Floats**, each row shows an **Outlet**, an **Allocate Floats** input (the amount to allocate to that outlet), and **Total Allocated**. Enter the float value for each outlet as needed. The summary totals update as you type.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click **Save**. If the total allocated exceeds the cash office floats total, an error message appears and save is blocked. Adjust the values so that **Allocated to Outlets** does not exceed **Cash Office Floats Total**, then save again.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What the page shows

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash Office Floats Total** | Total float available for the site (source of truth for allocation). |
| **Allocated to Outlets** | Sum of all float amounts currently entered for outlets. |
| **Unallocated** | Cash Office Floats Total minus Allocated to Outlets. Shown in red if over-allocated. |
| **Allocate Outlet Floats** | Table of outlets with an input for the float amount per outlet. |
| **Floats Allocation Activity** | History of float allocations (date/time, outlet, user, value) for auditing. |

<Note>
Allocated amounts cannot exceed the **Cash Office Floats Total**. Ensure your site or organisation has the correct total configured so you can distribute floats to outlets as needed.
