## Overview

**Cash Summary** (also referred to as **Cash Status Summary** or **Received Bank Summary**) gives you a summary view of cash status across sessions or outlets for a selected date range. Use it to see how much has been received, banked, or is pending, and to spot discrepancies or follow up on sessions that have not yet been banked. The page is view-only and helps with reconciliation and oversight.

## Accessing Cash Summary

Navigate to **Cash Management > Cash Summary**.

## Using the page

<Steps>
<Step title="Set date range">
  Use the **date range** picker in the card toolbar to set the start and end date (and time). The summary data is calculated for this period. The default is often the current day.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional filters">
  If the page offers a **Bag Number** or other filter (e.g. outlet), set it to narrow the summary to a specific bag or location.
</Step>

<Step title="Review summary">
  The page shows summary details (e.g. by outlet, by status, or totals). Use the figures to reconcile received and banked cash and to identify any sessions or bags that still need to be declared or banked.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What the page shows

The exact layout depends on your configuration. Typically you see:

- **Date range** — The period the summary covers.
- **Summary details** — Totals or breakdowns such as:
  - Amount received (or count of receives)
  - Amount banked (or count of banked sessions)
  - Pending or variance amounts
  - Breakdown by outlet, bag, or status

Use Cash Summary for end-of-day checks, auditing, and to ensure all declared sessions are banked and all received cash is accounted for.
