## Overview

**Cash Movements** shows the status of cash movements (e.g. lifts, drops, or transfers) across outlets for a selected date range. Use it to see which movements have been completed, are in progress, or are pending, and to drill into terminal-level detail. The page is view-only; it helps you monitor and reconcile cash flow between the cash office and terminals.

Navigate to **Cash Management > Cash Movements**.

## Using the page

<Steps>
<Step title="Set date range">
  Use the **date range** picker in the card toolbar to set the start and end date (and time) for the movements you want to see. The default is typically the current day.
</Step>

<Step title="Filter by outlet">
  Use the **outlet** filter (e.g. radio buttons or dropdown) to show movements for a specific outlet or for all outlets. The list of options depends on your hierarchy and permissions.
</Step>

<Step title="Review movement status">
  The main area shows outlets (and optionally terminals) with movement status. Expand or click through to see terminal-level detail where available. Use the information to reconcile cash and follow up on any movements that are not in the expected state.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What the page shows

- **Date range** — Start and end date/time for the movements displayed.
- **Outlet filter** — Restrict results to one outlet or view all.
- **Outlet / terminal list** — Status of cash movements per outlet (and per terminal). Details depend on your configuration (e.g. lift/drop status, counts, amounts).

This page is **informational**. It does not create or complete movements; it shows the current status so you can monitor and reconcile.
