## Overview

**Cash Vault** is used to record and view **terminal cash vault** declarations — the cash stored in the vault at a terminal (e.g. a safe or locked drawer). You can **create** a new declaration (terminal, value, and references) and **view** historical declarations with filters by date, outlet, and user. The view shows whether each declaration has been **Processed**, so you can track vault cash for reconciliation and auditing.
