## Overview

**Drawer Totals** shows a summary of cash-related totals per **outlet** and **terminal**: typically **Cash Floats** (starting float), **Cash Lift** (cash lifted/collected), **Cash Drops** (cash dropped into the till), and **Cash** (current or total cash). Counts (e.g. number of lifts or drops) may be shown as well. Use it to see at a glance how much float is out, how much has been lifted or dropped, and total cash by drawer/terminal for reconciliation and oversight. The page may auto-refresh so the figures stay current.
