## Overview

**Sales Tracker** shows sales data for a selected date range so you can monitor revenue in near real time or for a chosen period. The page typically displays sales by product group, outlet, or similar breakdown, with a date range picker and optional refresh. Use it to see how sales are performing and to spot trends or issues during the day or over a longer period.

## Accessing Sales Tracker

Navigate to **Cash Management > Revenue Tracker > Sales Tracker** (or **Cash Management** then the **Revenue Tracker** section, then **Sales Tracker**).

## Using the page

<Steps>
<Step title="Set date range">
  Use the **date range** picker at the top to set the start and end date (and time) for the sales you want to see. The default is often the current day.
</Step>

<Step title="View sales data">
  The main area shows sales (e.g. by product group, outlet, or tender). The layout may include a timer or auto-refresh so that data updates periodically. Use the figures for revenue monitoring and reporting.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust or export if available">
  If the page offers filters (e.g. outlet, site) or export, use them to narrow the view or download data for analysis.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What the page shows

- **Date range** — Period for which sales are displayed.
- **Sales breakdown** — Typically revenue or quantity by category (e.g. product group, outlet). Exact columns and groupings depend on your configuration.
- **Timer / refresh** — Some implementations show a countdown or refresh interval so the data stays current.

Sales Tracker is **read-only** and is for monitoring and reporting; it does not create or edit transactions.
