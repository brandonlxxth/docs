## Overview

**Risk Summary** shows a summary of risk or variance data (e.g. cash variances, exceptions) by **site** and **outlet** for a selected date range. You start at **sites** view, then drill into a site to see **outlets**, and optionally into an outlet for more detail. Use it to identify locations or periods with higher variance or risk and to support reconciliation and auditing.

## Using the page

<Steps>
<Step title="Set date range">
  Use the **date range** picker in the card toolbar to set the start and end date. The summary is calculated for this period.
</Step>

<Step title="View sites">
  The main area shows a **sites** view (e.g. list or cards of sites with risk or variance summary). Review which sites have variances or risk indicators.
</Step>

<Step title="Drill into a site">
  Click a site to see **outlet**-level detail for that site. Each outlet may show totals or counts (e.g. variance amount, number of sessions with variance).
</Step>

<Step title="Drill into an outlet (if available)">
  From the outlet list, you may be able to open an outlet to see more detail (e.g. by terminal or by session). Use this to investigate specific problem areas.
</Step>

<Step title="Go back">
  Use the **Back** button (or link) to return from outlet view to site view, or from site detail to the main list.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What the page shows

- **Date range** — Period for the risk/variance data.
- **Sites view** — Summary per site (e.g. variance totals, counts).
- **Outlet details** — When you drill into a site, outlets with their risk/variance figures.
- **Back** — Navigation to return to the previous level.

Risk Summary is **read-only**. Use it to monitor and investigate variances; resolve issues via [Sessions Declaration](/enterprise/pages/cash-management/sessions-declaration) (variance reasons) and banking as appropriate.
