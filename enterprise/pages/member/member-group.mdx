## Overview

The Member Group page lets you create and manage groups of members. Member groups are useful for organising members by characteristics, targeting specific campaigns, applying group-wide settings (e.g. vouchers, loyalty, accounts), and managing members more efficiently.

## Using Member Group

### Viewing member groups

When you open the Member Group page, you'll see a **search box at the top**. Type your search (e.g., group name) and results will appear below. Each result shows group name, description, number of members when shown, associated vouchers or promotions, and group status.

### Creating a member group

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Member Group page">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Member > Member Group** in the navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Create new group">
  Click the **+** icon to create a new member group.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter group information">
  Fill in the group details:
  - **Group Name**: A descriptive name for the group
  - **Description**: Optional description of the group's purpose
  - **Vouchers**: Select vouchers or promotions to associate with this group (optional)
</Step>

<Step title="Save the group">
  Review all information and click "Save" to create the group.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Editing a member group

To edit an existing member group:

1. Use the search box to find the group, then select it from the results

3. Modify the group details as needed:
   - Update the name or description
   - Add or remove associated vouchers
   - Change other group settings
4. Click "Save" to update the group

### Assigning vouchers to groups

Member groups can be associated with specific vouchers or promotions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open group details">
  Create a new group or edit an existing one.
</Step>

<Step title="Select vouchers">
  In the group form, find the "Vouchers" section and:
  - Browse available vouchers
  - Select vouchers to associate with this group
  - Selected vouchers will be available to all members in this group
</Step>

<Step title="Save the group">
  Click "Save" to associate the vouchers with the group.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Vouchers assigned to a member group become available to all members in that group. This is useful for targeted promotions or group-specific offers.

### Managing members in groups

<Info>
To add or remove individual members from groups, use the **Member Group Management** page. The Member Group page is for creating and configuring the groups themselves.
</Info>

See the [Member Group Management](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group-management) documentation for details on managing which members belong to which groups.

### Deleting a member group

<Warning>
Deleting a member group does not delete the members themselves. However, members will lose their association with the group, and any group-specific vouchers or settings will no longer apply.
</Warning>

To delete a member group:

1. Use the search box to find the group, then select it
2. Click the "Delete" action
3. Confirm the deletion
4. The group will be removed, but members remain in the system

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names**: Choose clear, descriptive names that indicate the group's purpose
- **Document group purpose**: Use the description field to note why the group exists
- **Review groups regularly**: Periodically review groups to ensure they're still relevant
- **Limit group count**: Avoid creating too many groups, as this can become difficult to manage
- **Use for campaigns**: Create temporary groups for specific campaigns, then archive or delete them when done

## Troubleshooting
