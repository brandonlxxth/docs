## Overview

The Account page allows you to create and manage account types that can be assigned to member groups. When a member is assigned to a member group that has an account, the member gains access to account features including top-ups and refunds.

<Info>
**Note**: The Account page is not available for organizations using Portugal fiscal features. If you're in Portugal, you'll use the Member page instead for account management.
</Info>

<Info>
**Account Features**: Top-ups and refunds are available to members when they are assigned to a member group that has an account associated with it. The Account page is where you create and configure these account types.
</Info>

## Viewing Accounts

When you open the Account page, you'll see a list of all member accounts in your system. The list shows:

- Account name
- Account type
- Associated member
- Current balance
- Account status

Use the search and filter options to find specific accounts.

## How Accounts Work with Member Groups

Accounts are associated with member groups, not individual members. Here's how it works:

1. **Create an Account**: Use this page to create account types (e.g., "Prepaid Account", "Credit Account")
2. **Assign to Member Group**: Assign the account to a member group (see [Member Group](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group) documentation)
3. **Assign Members to Group**: Add members to the group (see [Member Group Management](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group-management) documentation)
4. **Members Gain Access**: Once a member is in a group with an account, they can:
   - Use the account for purchases
   - Have their account topped up
   - Receive refunds to their account

<Info>
To manage individual member account balances, top-ups, and refunds, you'll work with the member's account through the Member page or the member's account interface, not through this Account configuration page.
</Info>

## Viewing Account Images

Accounts can have associated images. To view an account image:

1. The image will display in the account list if one is uploaded
2. Click on the account to see the full image in the account details

## Deleting an Account

<Warning>
Deleting an account is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure the account has no active transactions or outstanding balances before deleting.
</Warning>

To delete an account:

1. Find the account in the list
2. Click the "Delete" action
3. Confirm the deletion
4. The account will be removed from the system

## Account Types

Different account types may be available depending on your configuration:

- **Prepaid Accounts**: Members add funds in advance
- **Credit Accounts**: Members can make purchases on credit
- **Loyalty Accounts**: Accounts tied to loyalty programs

<Info>
The specific account types available depend on your organization's configuration. Contact your administrator if you need additional account types.
</Info>

## Best Practices

- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for account types so it's clear what they're for
- **Plan Group Structure**: Consider which member groups should have accounts before creating accounts
- **Document Purpose**: Use descriptions to explain what each account type is for
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review which groups have accounts to ensure the setup is still appropriate

## Troubleshooting
