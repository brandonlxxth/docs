## Overview

The Member Import page allows you to import multiple members into the system at once from a file. This is useful for bulk member creation, updating existing members, or migrating member data from another system.

## Preparing Your Import File

Before importing, prepare your member data file:

### Supported File Formats

- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: Most common format
- **Excel files**: May be converted to CSV first

### Required Information

Your import file should include member information such as:

- Member name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Member number or ID
- Other member details as configured

<Info>
The exact columns required depend on your organization's member configuration. Contact your administrator for a template file showing the required format.
</Info>

### File Format Tips

- Use a header row with column names
- Ensure data is properly formatted (dates, numbers, etc.)
- Remove any special characters that might cause issues
- Check for duplicate email addresses or member numbers

## Importing Members

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Member Import">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Member > Member Import** in the navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload your file">
  Click "Choose File" or "Upload" and select your member data file from your computer.
</Step>

<Step title="Parse the file">
  After uploading, click "Parse File" or similar to analyze the file structure. The system will:
  - Identify columns in your file
  - Map columns to member fields
  - Show a preview of the data
  - Highlight any potential issues
</Step>

<Step title="Review parse results">
  Review the parse results to ensure:
  - All columns are correctly mapped
  - Data looks correct in the preview
  - No critical errors are shown
  - Warnings are acceptable
</Step>

<Step title="Import the members">
  If everything looks correct, click "Import" or "Import Members" to begin the import process.
</Step>

<Step title="Review import results">
  After import completes, review the results:
  - **Successfully imported**: Members that were created or updated
  - **Failed imports**: Members that couldn't be imported with error messages
  - **Summary**: Total counts of successful and failed imports
</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Parse Results

When you parse a file, the system shows:

### Column Mapping

The system attempts to automatically map your file columns to member fields. You may need to:

- Confirm automatic mappings are correct
- Manually map columns that weren't recognized
- Skip columns that aren't needed

### Data Preview

A preview shows how your data will be imported:

- First few rows of data
- How fields will be populated
- Any formatting that will be applied

### Validation Warnings

The system may show warnings for:

- Duplicate email addresses
- Invalid data formats
- Missing required fields
- Potential data issues

<Warning>
Review all warnings before importing. Some warnings may prevent members from being imported correctly.
</Warning>

## Import Options

Depending on your configuration, you may have options for:

### Create New Members

Import will create new member records for all rows in the file.

### Update Existing Members

Import will update existing members based on matching criteria (e.g., email or member number).

### Create or Update

Import will create new members if they don't exist, or update existing members if they do.

<Info>
The available import options depend on your organization's configuration. Contact your administrator for details about your import settings.
</Info>

## Handling Import Errors

If some members fail to import:

### Common Error Reasons

- **Duplicate email**: Email address already exists in the system
- **Invalid format**: Data doesn't match required format (e.g., invalid date)
- **Missing required field**: Required information is missing
- **Invalid member number**: Member number format is incorrect or already in use

### Resolving Errors

1. Review the error messages for each failed import
2. Correct the data in your source file
3. Re-import only the corrected rows, or
4. Fix the issues and re-import the entire file

### Exporting Error Details

You may be able to export a list of failed imports to help identify and fix issues.

## Best Practices

- **Test with small files first**: Import a few members first to verify the format
- **Backup existing data**: Ensure you have backups before bulk imports
- **Validate data beforehand**: Check your file for errors before importing
- **Use templates**: Request a template file from your administrator to ensure correct format
- **Review results carefully**: Always review import results to catch any issues early
- **Import during off-peak hours**: Large imports may take time; schedule during low-usage periods

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="File won't upload">
  If your file won't upload:
  - Check the file size (there may be size limits)
  - Verify the file format is supported
  - Ensure the file isn't corrupted
  - Try saving the file in a different format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Columns aren't mapping correctly">
  If columns aren't mapping:
  - Ensure your file has a header row with clear column names
  - Check that column names match expected field names
  - Manually map columns if automatic mapping fails
  - Contact your administrator for the correct column names
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Many members failed to import">
  If many imports fail:
  - Review the error messages to identify common issues
  - Check if there's a pattern (e.g., all have the same missing field)
  - Fix the source data and re-import
  - Consider importing in smaller batches to isolate issues
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Import is very slow">
  If import takes a long time:
  - Large files may take several minutes to process
  - Avoid importing during peak usage times
  - Consider splitting very large files into smaller batches
  - Contact support if imports consistently take too long
</Accordion>
