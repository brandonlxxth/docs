## Overview

The Member Group Management page lets you manage which members belong to which groups. This is where you add members to groups, remove them from groups, and view the membership of each group.

<Info>
**Difference from Member Group**: The [Member Group](/enterprise/pages/member/member-group) page is for creating and configuring groups themselves. The Member Group Management page is for managing which members are in each group.
</Info>

## Using Member Group Management

### Viewing group memberships

When you open the Member Group Management page, you'll see a **search box at the top**. Search for a member group by name; when you select a group, the members in that group appear below. You can view which members belong to each group and see member name, email, and member number.

### Adding members to a group

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Member Group Management">
  Navigate to **Configuration > Member > Member Group Management** in the navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a group">
  Use the search box to find the member group you want to manage, then select it. The members in that group will appear below.
</Step>

<Step title="Add members">
  To add members to the group:
  - Use the search box to find members (by name, email, or member number)
  - Check the box next to each member you want to add
  - Or use "Select All" to add all visible members in the results
  - The changes are saved automatically when you check/uncheck boxes
</Step>
</Steps>

### Removing members from a group

To remove members from a group:

1. Open the Member Group Management page
2. Select the group you want to manage
3. Find the members you want to remove
4. Uncheck the box next to each member
5. Changes are saved automatically

<Info>
Removing a member from a group does not delete the member. The member remains in the system but is no longer part of that group.

## Member group management reference

| Element | What it does |
|---------|----------------|
| **Group selector** | Search for and select the member group whose membership you want to manage. |
| **Member list** | Shows members; checked = in the group, unchecked = not in the group. Changes save when you check or uncheck. |
| **Search** | Find members by name, email, or member number. |
| **Select All** | Add or remove all visible members in the results from the selected group. |

### Viewing all members

The page shows all members in your system, with indicators showing which groups each member belongs to:

- **Checked**: Member is in the selected group
- **Unchecked**: Member is not in the selected group
- You can see membership across multiple groups

### Searching for members

Use the **search box at the top** to find members by name, email, or member number. Results appear below. You can then add or remove members from the selected group by checking or unchecking the boxes.

### Bulk operations

You can perform bulk operations on members:

### Add Multiple Members

1. Use the search box to narrow results
2. Check "Select All" to select all visible members in the results
3. All selected members will be added to the group

### Remove Multiple Members

1. Select the group
2. Use the search box to find specific members
3. Uncheck "Select All" or individually uncheck members
4. All unchecked members will be removed from the group

### Understanding group membership

### Multiple Group Membership

Members can belong to multiple groups simultaneously. For example, a member might be in:
- "VIP Members" group
- "Frequent Customers" group
- "Email Subscribers" group

### Group Benefits

When a member is in a group, they:
- Receive vouchers assigned to that group
- Are included in campaigns targeting that group
- Have access to group-specific features or pricing
- Can be included in group-based reporting

## Best Practices

- **Review memberships regularly**: Periodically review group memberships to ensure they're accurate
- **Use search effectively**: Use the search box to find specific members quickly
- **Document changes**: Note when members are added or removed from important groups
- **Verify before bulk operations**: Double-check the results before using "Select All" to avoid unintended changes
- **Keep groups focused**: Ensure members in a group actually meet the group's criteria

### Common workflows

### Adding New Members to a Group

When new members join:

1. Open Member Group Management
2. Select the appropriate group (e.g., "New Members")
3. Search for the new members
4. Check the boxes to add them to the group

### Moving Members Between Groups

To move members from one group to another:

1. Select the source group
2. Find and note which members need to move
3. Uncheck them from the source group
4. Select the destination group
5. Find the same members and check them

### Cleaning Up Inactive Members

To remove inactive members from a group:

1. Select the group and use the search box to find inactive members
2. Uncheck all inactive members in the results
3. They'll be removed from the group but remain in the system
