## Overview

The User Profile page lets you manage your personal account settings in the Management Portal. Access it by clicking your name or avatar in the top-right corner and selecting **Profile**, or navigate directly to `/User/UserProfile`.

## Required permissions

| Feature | User Role Permission | Tab in User Role Config |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| User Profile | N/A | Available to all authenticated users |
| Manage API Keys | Manage Api Keys | Configuration (Admin) |

<Note>
Every authenticated user can access their own User Profile. The **Manage Api Keys** permission is only required to create and manage API keys.
</Note>

## Accessing your profile

1. Click your name or avatar in the top-right corner of the Management Portal.
2. Select **Profile** from the dropdown menu.

## Profile settings

### Time zone

Your time zone determines how dates and times display throughout the Management Portal, including on the Dashboard, in reports, and in activity logs.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Time zone** | Select your local time zone from the dropdown. All dates and times in the portal display in this time zone. |

<Warning>
If your time zone is incorrect, Dashboard metrics, report date ranges, and activity timestamps will appear offset. Ensure this matches your operating region.
</Warning>

### Trading Day start time

The Trading Day start time defines when your business day begins for Dashboard calculations.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Trading Day start time** | The time your trading day starts (default: 00:00). |

**How it works:**

- **Default (00:00–23:59)**: A trading day runs from midnight to midnight.
- **Custom start time (e.g. 06:00)**: Transactions before 06:00 count toward the previous trading day. For example, if your trading day starts at 06:00, a transaction at 02:00 on Tuesday is included in Monday's totals on the Dashboard.

This setting affects Dashboard date calculations including "Today", "Yesterday", and other date-based filters.

<Note>
This setting applies to the Dashboard only. Reports use their own date range selections.

### API key generation

Generate API keys to authenticate with the Kappture API. API keys allow external applications to access data and perform actions via the API.

#### API access scope

API keys are linked to your user account and organisation. The API operates at the organisation level and provides access to organisation-wide data.

#### Generating an API key

<Step title="Open your profile">
  Click your name in the top-right corner and select **Profile**.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to API keys">
  Go to the **API Keys** section of your profile.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate a new key">
  Click **Generate API Key**. The key displays once—copy it immediately.
</Step>

<Step title="Store the key securely">
  Save the API key in a secure location. You cannot retrieve it again after leaving the page.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
API keys grant access to your account with your full permissions. Do not share them or commit them to version control. If a key is compromised, delete it and generate a new one.
</Warning>

For API documentation, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction).
