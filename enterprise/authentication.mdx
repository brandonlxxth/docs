## Overview

The Management Portal uses secure authentication to protect your business data. This guide explains how to log in, manage your account, and keep your account secure.

## Logging In

### Standard Login

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the login page">
  Go to your Management Portal login URL (provided by your administrator).

  Type your email address in the email field. This is the email address associated with your account.

<Step title="Enter your password">
  Enter your password in the password field.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

If your organization uses Single Sign-On:

1. Click the "Sign in with SSO" button on the login page
2. You'll be redirected to your organization's SSO provider
3. Enter your SSO credentials
4. You'll be automatically redirected back to the Management Portal

SSO login allows you to use your organization's existing credentials without needing a separate Management Portal password.
</Info>

## Session Management

### Session Duration

Your login session remains active for 12 hours of inactivity. After this time, you'll need to log in again.

<Tip>
If you're working actively, your session will stay active. The 12-hour timeout only applies when you're not using the system.
</Tip>

### Staying Logged In

To keep your session active:

- Use the Management Portal regularly
- Avoid closing your browser for extended periods
- Don't clear your browser cookies (they're needed for session management)

### Logging Out

To log out securely:

1. Click on your user menu in the top right corner
2. Select "Log Out" or "Sign Out"
3. You'll be redirected to the login page

<Warning>
Always log out when using a shared or public computer to protect your account.

## Account Security

### Password Best Practices

- Don't share your password with anyone
- Change your password regularly
- Don't reuse passwords from other accounts

2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for password reset instructions
4. Follow the link to create a new password

<Info>
If you don't receive a password reset email, check your spam folder or contact your administrator.
</Info>

### Changing Your Password

To change your password while logged in:

3. Enter your current password

## Access Control

### Understanding Permissions

Your access to different features in the Management Portal is controlled by permissions assigned by your administrator. You'll only see menu items and features that you have permission to access.

### Requesting Additional Access

If you need access to features you don't currently see:

1. Contact your system administrator
2. Explain what you need to do and why
3. Your administrator can grant the appropriate permissions

### Site-Level Access

Some permissions are site-specific, meaning you may have access to certain features only for specific sites or outlets. This helps maintain proper access control in multi-location organizations.
