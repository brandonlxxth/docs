## Overview

The Site Management section lets you configure and manage your organisational structure, including sites, outlets, outlet types, and preparation points. This hierarchical structure (Organisation → Sites → Outlets → Preparation Points) supports multi-location operations with centralised management.

## Understanding Your Organization Structure

Your organization follows this hierarchy:

```
Organization
  └── Sites
      └── Outlets
          └── Preparation Points
```

<Info>
This structure allows you to manage operations at different levels, from organization-wide settings to outlet-specific configurations.
