This release introduces the new Click & Collect Journal and Order Delivered Report, along with several enhancements to transfer templates, weekly finance summaries, stock take reports, and receipt formatting. Bug fixes address pricing imports, user restrictions, and permission issues.


You will now no longer see restrictions that your user or user role doesn't have access to. This means that if you create a restriction you will need to assign to your user or user role to see it.
