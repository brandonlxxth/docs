## 🐞 Bug Fixes

| Internal Ticket ID | Issue | Resolution
|:------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 8697283wf | When a customer taps repeatedly on a Kiosk sub menu product the button could become unselectable. | Sub menu product buttons will now behave correctly.
| 869743vqx | When a customer taps repeatedly on a Quickserve sub menu product the button could become unselectable. | Sub menu product buttons will now behave correctly.
| 8697n2nrd | Printing a bill for an open order would display a close date/time line. | This line should never be displayed on a bill and has been removed. Normal table sale/refund includes the close date/time as expected.
| 8697mf54v | K-stock product count sheet menus (verify, close, requisition, transfer) would reset scroll/search position to default if a relevant sync change applied to the terminal. | Stock menus with product count sheet functions now enforce critical state checks to postpone sync changes applying until ready.
| 869712hbp | Various fixes and improvements to Swedbank EFT interface for Android
| 8697hxyta | If a previously completed EFT order was refunded (& the EFT interface supports merged EFT receipts), we would include duplicate EFT receipt data in the completed refund receipt. | Refund EFT order will no longer include duplicate print data.
