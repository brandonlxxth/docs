## 🐞 Bug Fixes

| Internal Ticket ID | Issue | Resolution 
|:------------|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------|
| 8698b1gkd | Fixed issue where starting a refund order & releasing without paying it off would break the active bar order | Order data is stored correctly, refund orders can no longer break and cause issues closing session
| 8695ggj33 | K2/Windows Freedompay EFT would always display & map card transaction failed for expected refusal outcomes from FCC (for example a cancel or decline) | All responses with decision code R (refusal) are mapped to cancelled. Card transaction failed is no longer displayed unless decision code F (failure) is given.
| 8697dqm1b | Logging out the guest operator on Kiosk or Quickserve could cause issues placing transactions on the next order | The guest op will now correctly log back in if an operator attempted to sign out the guest op. 
| 8698b0c8r | Kiosk product info & sub product menus had several alignment issues | All product info & sub product menu UI properties are now correctly aligned
| 869656wdu | Sync load test tool issue | Resolved mismatched dialogs
| 8698by4tn | Sync load test tab was displayed in the advanced support screen by default despite being un-usable for non developers | Tab is now hidden correctly when developer mode is not enabled
| 8697v9cbt | Lots of small fixes & code improvements |
