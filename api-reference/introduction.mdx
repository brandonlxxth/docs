description: 'Kappture Integrate API v2 - Complete REST API for POS integration, ordering, stock management, and more'
---

## Welcome

The **Kappture Integrate API v2.0.0** is a comprehensive REST API that enables third-party integrations with the Kappture hospitality and retail platform. Use this API to:

- **Place orders** programmatically from your own ordering channels
- **Manage products**, menus, layouts, and pricing
- **Post third-party transactions** from external POS systems
- **Manage stock** - adjustments, deliveries, orders, and inventory
- **Access customer data** - members, loyalty, vouchers
- **Configure terminals** - outlets, preparation points, sessions

All endpoints are listed in the sidebar, organized by category.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get API Credentials

Generate your API credentials in the [Kappture Management Portal](https://admin.kappture.com):

1. Log in to the Management Portal
2. Navigate to your **Profile Page**
3. Create a new **API Key** and **API Secret**
4. Save these credentials securely

### 2. Generate a JWT Token

All API requests require a JWT token. Generate one using your credentials:

```bash
POST https://api.eu-west-1.prod.kappture.com/auth
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY

{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "api_secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "expiresAt": "2025-02-12T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 3. Make API Requests

Include both the JWT token and API key in every request:

```bash
GET https://api.eu-west-1.prod.kappture.com/product?count=100&page=1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URLs

Choose the environment that matches your account:

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| **Production** | `https://api.eu-west-1.kappture.com` |
| **Staging** | `https://api.eu-west-1.staging.kappture.com` |

## Authentication

### JWT Token Authentication

The Kappture API uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication with API keys.

**Security Requirements:**
- All requests require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- All requests require an `x-api-key: <your_api_key>` header
- Tokens are valid for up to 24 hours
- Tokens remain valid even if API credentials are deleted
- Authorization is cached with a 300-second TTL

**Token Lifecycle:**
1. Generate token using `/auth` endpoint
2. Use token for all API requests
3. Token expires after 24 hours
4. Generate a new token when expired

## Key Concepts

Understanding these core entities will help you work with the API effectively:

### Organizational Hierarchy

- **Group** - Top-level organization (your company)
- **Brand** - Brand within a group (e.g., restaurant chain brands)
- **Region** - Geographic grouping of sites
- **Site** - Ordering area (hospitality venue, retail location, stadium)
- **Outlet** - Physical ordering location (bar, restaurant, concession stand)
- **Terminal** - POS device or kiosk at an outlet

### Products & Pricing

- **Product** - Items customers can order (food, drink, merchandise)
- **Product Group** - Category grouping (Starters, Mains, Desserts, Beverages)
- **Menu** - Collection of products available for ordering
- **Price Band** - Pricing tier (Standard, Happy Hour, VIP, Event Pricing)
- **Session** - Trading period with associated price band (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

### Ordering

- **Preparation Point** - Kitchen or collection point where orders are prepared
- **Order Authorization** - Stage 1: Validate order, apply vouchers, check stock
- **Order Commit** - Stage 2: Finalize order after payment
- **Transaction** - Completed order with payment

### Layouts & Display

- **Layout** - POS screen configuration with product buttons
- **Resource** - Background images and visual assets
- **Menu** - Self-service ordering menu structure

### Members & Loyalty

- **Member** - Customer loyalty account
- **Member Group** - Customer segmentation
- **Voucher** - Discount vouchers and gift cards
- **Account** - Member balance for cashless payments

### Payments

- **Tender** - Payment method (Cash, Card, Mobile Wallet, Account, Voucher)

### Stock Management

- **Stock Adjustment** - Stock level corrections
- **Stock Order** - Orders placed to suppliers
- **Stock Delivery** - Received stock from suppliers
- **Supplier** - Stock vendor
- **Unit of Measure** - Units for stock tracking (kg, liters, cases)

## Common Workflows

The API supports several common integration patterns. Click through for detailed step-by-step guides:

    Place orders from mobile apps, web, kiosks, or delivery platforms. Two-stage authorization and commit process with vouchers, stock checks, and payment handling.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Third-Party Transactions" icon="upload" href="/api-reference/workflows/third-party-transactions">
    Post sales from external POS systems for consolidated reporting. Bulk upload up to 50 transactions with automatic product creation.

    Create and manage POS screen layouts programmatically. Position product buttons, menus, and tenders for optimal operator experience.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Pagination

Most list endpoints support pagination using `count` and `page` parameters:

```bash
GET /product?count=100&page=1
```

- **count** - Records per page (min: 1, max: 100)
- **page** - Page number (starts at 1)

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "products": [...],
  "totalCount": 523,
  "pageCount": 6,
  "currentPage": 1
}
```

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | Request succeeded |
| `201` | Created | Resource created successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Invalid or expired JWT token |
| `403` | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found | Endpoint or resource not found |
| `409` | Conflict | Duplicate resource (e.g., product with same PLU) |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity | Validation failed |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Server error |
| `503` | Service Unavailable | Service temporarily unavailable |

### Error Response Format

All error responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "Descriptive error message",
  "fields": "Comma-separated list of invalid fields"
}
```

**Example:**
```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Invalid product ID",
  "fields": "productId"
}
```

## Create vs Update Pattern

Most PUT endpoints use an **upsert pattern**:

- **Create:** `PUT /resource` with `id: 0`
- **Update:** `PUT /resource` with existing `id > 0`

**Example:**
```json
// Create new product
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "New Product",
  "groupId": 5
}

// Update existing product
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Updated Product",
  "groupId": 5
}
```

## Date & Time Format

All date/time values use **RFC3339 format**:

```
2025-02-11T14:30:00Z        // UTC
2025-02-11T14:30:00+00:00   // UTC with offset
2025-02-11T09:30:00-05:00   // EST
```

## Best Practices

### Token Management

- Generate tokens at application startup
- Reuse tokens for multiple requests (valid 24 hours)
- Implement token refresh logic before expiration
- Store tokens securely (never in client-side code)

### API Keys

- Store API keys as environment variables
- Never commit API keys to source control
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for dev/staging/production

### Error Handling

- Implement retry logic for `500` and `503` errors
- Log all API errors for debugging
- Validate data before sending to reduce `400` errors
- Handle `401` errors by refreshing JWT token

### Performance

- Use pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data (products, menus)
- Batch operations where possible (e.g., bulk transaction upload)
- Filter responses using query parameters

### Data Integrity

- Validate product IDs exist before ordering
- Check session availability before placing orders
- Verify tender availability at the outlet
- Handle stock depletion gracefully

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to ensure platform stability. If you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

**Best Practices:**
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Batch operations when possible
- Cache responses to reduce API calls
- Contact support if you need higher limits
