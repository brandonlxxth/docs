## What Are Terminals?

**Terminals** are the point-of-sale (PoS) devices used by operators and customers at your outlets. Each terminal runs specialized software that connects to the Management Portal to receive configuration, sync data, and send orders and transactions.

See [Terminal Types](#terminal-types) below for the full list of terminal types and their use cases.

## How Terminals Work

### Configuration

Terminals are configured in the **Management Portal** under **Configuration > Terminal > Hierarchy**. Each terminal:
- Belongs to an **Outlet**
- Has a **Terminal type** that determines its role and features
- Uses **Layouts** assigned to the outlet's **Sessions** (the layout shown depends on which session is active)
- Uses **Product Prices** from the session's **Price Band**
- Has **Operators** and **Operator Roles** that control what staff can do
- Uses **Tenders** for payment processing
- Has **Printing** settings for receipt and kitchen printers, a **Checklist** assignment, and **Pay at Table** options (configured in the terminal's **Printing**, **Configuration**, and **Options** tabs in [Hierarchy](https://admin.kappture.com/Hierarchy))

### Data Synchronization

Terminals maintain a local database that syncs with the Management Portal in real-time. The **Sync Service** detects changes in the portal database and pushes updates to connected terminals via WebSocket.

**What gets synchronized:**

**Organization-wide data** (same for all terminals):
- **Product Groups**, **Allergens**, **Ingredients**, **Courses**, **Waste Reasons**
- **Operator Roles**, **Preparation Points**, **Checklists**, **Tenders**
- **Sessions**, **Price Bands**, **Terminals**, **Resources**

**Outlet-specific data** (filtered by terminal's outlet):
- **Products** — Product catalog, prices, images
- **Layouts** — Button layouts and screen configurations
- **Operators** — Operator accounts and roles assigned to the outlet
- **Session Layouts** — Which layouts apply to each session
- **Stock** — Stock levels and movements (when stock is enabled for the outlet and terminal)

**Preparation Point data** (filtered by terminal's prep point):
- **Future Orders** — Orders scheduled for the preparation point

Changes made in the Management Portal are automatically detected and pushed to terminals. Terminals acknowledge each update and request the next set of changes, ensuring data consistency.

**Connection Status Indicator:**

Terminals display a **Server** connection indicator (LED) on the top bar showing sync status:
- **Green** — Connected to the Sync Service and receiving updates
- **Amber** — Terminal has internet connectivity but cannot communicate with the Sync Service (data sync paused)
- **Red** — Terminal is offline (no internet connection)

When the indicator is amber, the terminal continues operating with its local database but will not receive configuration or data updates until the sync connection is restored.

### Order Processing

When an operator takes an order:
1. Products are added to the order (from layout buttons or search)
2. The order is processed by **Terminal Logic** (applies vouchers, calculates totals, validates)
3. Payment is processed via **Terminal EFT** (if card payment) or handled directly (if cash/account)
4. The order is sent to the server and can be forwarded to **Preparation Points** (kitchens, bars)
5. Receipts are printed (if configured)
6. The transaction is recorded and synced back to the Management Portal

### Sessions

Terminals operate within **sessions** — named operational periods (e.g. "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Evening"). Each session:
- Has a **Price Band** that determines which product prices are used
- Uses specific **Layouts** configured for that outlet and session
- Has **Valid Times** (start and end time) and day-of-week **availability** toggles, configured on the [Session](https://admin.kappture.com/Session) page under the **Self Checkout Availability** tab

Operators **open a session** at the start of their shift and **close it** at the end. Kitchen Management Screen (KMS) terminals do not require sessions.

## Terminal Types

Each terminal type has its own documentation page covering all workflows:

| **Self-Checkout (SCO)** | [Self-Checkout](/terminal/types/sco) | Customer-operated checkout |
| **Self-Service** | [Self-Service](/terminal/types/self-service) | Self-service customer ordering |
| **Kiosk** | [Kiosk](/terminal/types/kiosk) | Self-service kiosk ordering |
| **Kitchen Management Screen (KMS)** | [KMS](/terminal/types/kms) | Order management at preparation points |
